# Frontend Implementation Progress

## Overview
We've successfully implemented the core structure and UI components for the Vibes voice journaling application frontend. The implementation follows modern React Native development practices, using TypeScript for type safety and a well-organized project structure for maintainability.

## Completed Components

### Navigation
- Implemented a complete navigation structure with:
  - Authentication flow (login/register)
  - Tab-based main navigation (Home, Journal, Record, Calendar, Settings)
  - Stack navigation for detailed views

### Authentication
- Created authentication context for managing user state
- Implemented login and registration screens
- Added Google authentication integration
- Set up token storage with AsyncStorage

### Journal Management
- Developed journal list screen with search and tag filtering
- Implemented journal entry detail screen
- Created journal entry form for adding/editing entries
- Added tag management with the TagInput component

### UI Components
- JournalCard component for displaying entries
- Recording interface with visual feedback
- Basic placeholder screens for Calendar and Settings
- Consistent styling across the app

## Next Steps

1. **Voice Recording Integration**
   - Connect the recording UI to actual device recording APIs
   - Implement real-time transcription with the backend

2. **Calendar View Enhancement**
   - Replace placeholder with functional calendar
   - Implement date-based filtering of journal entries

3. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Optimize performance for large journal collections
   - Fix any remaining type errors

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Configure build settings for production
   - Prepare for app store submission

## Technical Details

The frontend implementation uses:
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Navigation for routing
- Context API for state management
- Axios for API communication
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Expo AV for audio recording (to be implemented)
