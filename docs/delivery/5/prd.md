# PBI-5: Migration and Testing Framework

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-PBI-5)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive testing framework and migration tools to ensure safe transition from the current Argon2-based secret tags system to the new OPAQUE zero-knowledge system. This PBI provides the infrastructure needed to validate security properties and migrate existing users safely.

## Problem Statement

The transition from Argon2 to OPAQUE requires careful migration planning and comprehensive testing:
- Existing users have secret tags that must be preserved during migration
- Security properties of the new system must be validated through extensive testing
- Performance impact must be measured and optimized
- Rollback procedures must be available in case of issues
- User experience during migration must be seamless and secure

This PBI ensures the OPAQUE implementation is thoroughly tested and existing users can migrate safely without data loss.

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement comprehensive testing and migration tools so that existing users can safely migrate to the new OPAQUE system.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As an existing user, I want to migrate my secret tags seamlessly so that I don't lose access to my encrypted entries
- As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can validate all security properties of the OPAQUE system
- As a security auditor, I want migration validation tools so that I can verify no data is lost during the transition
- As a product manager, I want rollback capabilities so that we can safely deploy the new system with confidence

## Technical Approach

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phased Migration Approach**
   ```typescript
   interface MigrationPlan {
     phase1: "Dual system support - both V2 and V3 active";
     phase2: "User-initiated migration with validation";
     phase3: "Automated migration for remaining users";
     phase4: "V2 system deprecation and cleanup";
   }
   ```

2. **Migration Validation**
   ```typescript
   class MigrationValidator {
     async validateMigration(userId: string): Promise<ValidationResult> {
       // Verify all V2 secret tags are accessible
       // Test V3 authentication with same phrases
       // Validate encrypted content is preserved
       // Confirm no data loss during migration
     }
   }
   ```

### Testing Framework

1. **Security Property Testing**
   ```typescript
   describe('OPAQUE Security Properties', () => {
     test('Zero-knowledge server verification');
     test('Traffic analysis resistance');
     test('Memory security and key erasure');
     test('Side-channel attack resistance');
     test('Duress protection capabilities');
   });
   ```

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Authentication latency benchmarks
   - Memory usage profiling
   - Battery impact measurement
   - Network traffic analysis
   - Mobile device compatibility testing

3. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end voice workflow testing
   - Cross-platform compatibility validation
   - Error handling and recovery testing
   - Migration workflow validation

### Migration Tools

1. **User Migration Interface**
   - Migration status dashboard
   - Step-by-step migration wizard
   - Progress tracking and validation
   - Rollback options and emergency procedures

2. **Administrative Tools**
   - Bulk migration utilities
   - Migration monitoring and metrics
   - Error tracking and resolution
   - Performance monitoring during migration

## UX/UI Considerations

- **Migration Transparency**: Users should understand what's happening during migration
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear progress indicators for migration steps
- **Error Recovery**: User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- **Validation Confirmation**: Users should be able to verify migration success
- **Rollback Access**: Emergency rollback should be easily accessible

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Migration Framework**
   - [ ] Dual system support allows V2 and V3 to coexist safely
   - [ ] User migration wizard guides users through secure transition
   - [ ] Migration validation confirms all secret tags are preserved
   - [ ] Rollback procedures restore V2 functionality if needed

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - [ ] Unit tests cover all OPAQUE cryptographic operations
   - [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end voice workflow
   - [ ] Security tests verify zero-knowledge properties
   - [ ] Performance tests confirm mobile device compatibility

3. **Migration Validation**
   - [ ] Pre-migration testing validates user's current secret tags
   - [ ] Post-migration testing confirms all functionality works
   - [ ] Data integrity checks prevent any loss of encrypted content
   - [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback and recovery options

4. **Administrative Tools**
   - [ ] Migration monitoring dashboard shows system-wide progress
   - [ ] Performance metrics track impact during migration
   - [ ] Error tracking identifies and resolves migration issues
   - [ ] Bulk migration tools handle large user populations efficiently

## Dependencies

- **All Previous PBIs**: Migration requires complete OPAQUE implementation
- **Database Infrastructure**: Migration requires careful database schema management
- **User Communication**: Migration requires user notification and education
- **Support Infrastructure**: Migration requires enhanced customer support capabilities

## Open Questions

1. **Migration Timeline**: What is the optimal timeline for phased migration rollout?
2. **Rollback Scope**: How long should V2 system remain available as fallback?
3. **Migration Validation**: What level of testing is required to validate each user's migration?
4. **Performance Impact**: What is the acceptable performance impact during migration periods?
