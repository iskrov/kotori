## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Security Scanning Tools Setup (4 hours)
1. **Vulnerability Scanning Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Security scanning configuration
   security-tools:
     dependency-check: npm audit, safety
     static-analysis: CodeQL, Semgrep
     dynamic-testing: OWASP ZAP
     container-scanning: Trivy
   ```

2. **Static Analysis Setup**
   - Configure CodeQL for code analysis
   - Set up Semgrep for security patterns
   - Install and configure Bandit for Python
   - Set up ESLint security rules

### Phase 2: Automated Scanning Implementation (6 hours)
1. **CI/CD Security Integration**
   ```yaml
   name: Security Scan
   on: [push, pull_request, schedule]
   jobs:
     security-scan:
       steps:
         - name: Dependency Vulnerability Scan
         - name: Static Code Analysis
         - name: Dynamic Security Testing
         - name: Container Security Scan
   ```

2. **Security Scan Automation**
   ```typescript
   class SecurityScanner {
     async runComprehensiveScan(): Promise<SecurityScanResults> {
       return {
         dependencies: await this.scanDependencies(),
         staticAnalysis: await this.runStaticAnalysis(),
         dynamicTesting: await this.runDynamicTests(),
         compliance: await this.checkCompliance()
       };
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Security Monitoring Setup (4 hours)
1. **Real-Time Monitoring Configuration**
   ```typescript
   class SecurityMonitor {
     async monitorSecurity(): Promise<void> {
       // Monitor for new vulnerabilities
       // Track security metrics
       // Generate security alerts
       // Update security dashboard
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Alert and Notification System**
   - Configure vulnerability alerts
   - Set up security metric thresholds
   - Create incident response triggers
   - Implement security reporting

### Phase 4: Security Gate Implementation (3 hours)
1. **Security Quality Gates**
   ```yaml
   security-gates:
     vulnerability-threshold:
       critical: 0
       high: 0
       medium: 5
     compliance-score:
       minimum: 95%
     security-test-coverage:
       minimum: 90%
   ```

2. **Automated Security Enforcement**
   - Block builds with critical vulnerabilities
   - Enforce security compliance standards
   - Require security review for changes
   - Automated security documentation updates

## Test Plan

### Security Scanning Validation

1. **Vulnerability Detection Tests**
   - **Objective**: Ensure all vulnerability types are detected
   - **Scope**: Dependencies, code vulnerabilities, configuration issues
   - **Method**: Introduce known vulnerabilities and verify detection
   - **Success Criteria**: All known vulnerability types detected

2. **Compliance Validation Tests**
   - **Objective**: Verify compliance with security standards
   - **Scope**: OWASP Top 10, cryptographic standards, data protection
   - **Method**: Compliance checklist validation and testing
   - **Success Criteria**: All compliance requirements met

3. **Security Gate Tests**
   - **Objective**: Validate security gates enforce standards
   - **Scope**: CI/CD pipeline security enforcement
   - **Method**: Test with various security scenarios
   - **Success Criteria**: Security gates properly block failing builds

4. **Monitoring System Tests**
   - **Objective**: Ensure security monitoring works correctly
   - **Scope**: Real-time monitoring, alerting, reporting
   - **Method**: Monitoring system validation and testing
   - **Success Criteria**: Accurate monitoring and timely alerts

### Security Scanning Coverage

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Known vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD)
   - Package-specific vulnerability sources
   - License compliance checking
   - Outdated dependency detection

2. **Code Security Issues**
   - Injection vulnerabilities
   - Authentication and authorization flaws
   - Cryptographic implementation issues
   - Data exposure vulnerabilities

3. **Configuration Security**
   - Insecure default configurations
   - Missing security headers
   - Weak cryptographic configurations
   - Access control misconfigurations
