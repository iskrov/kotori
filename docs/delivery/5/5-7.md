## Requirements

- Build React Native web app using Expo
- Create containerized web server (nginx or Node.js)
- Deploy to Cloud Run as `kotori-web` service
- Configure custom domain `app.kotori.io` or `kotori.io`
- Set up proper CORS and API connectivity to backend
- Ensure responsive design works on desktop and mobile browsers

## Implementation Plan

1. **Build Web App**:
   - Run `expo export:web` to generate static web build
   - Verify build includes all necessary assets and routing

2. **Create Dockerfile**:
   - Use nginx or Node.js to serve static files
   - Configure proper MIME types and routing for SPA
   - Set up health check endpoint

3. **Deploy to Cloud Run**:
   - Build and push container image to Artifact Registry
   - Deploy as `kotori-web` service
   - Configure environment variables for API endpoint
   - Set up proper scaling and resource allocation

4. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Map custom domain (e.g., `app.kotori.io` or `kotori.io`)
   - Configure TLS certificate via Certificate Manager
   - Update DNS records

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify frontend can communicate with backend API
   - Test authentication flow (OPAQUE)
   - Verify speech-to-text functionality
   - Test responsive design on various devices

## Verification

- âœ… Web app builds successfully with `expo export:web`
- âœ… Container image built and pushed to Artifact Registry
- âœ… Cloud Run service `kotori-web` deployed and accessible at `https://kotori-web-412014849981.northamerica-northeast2.run.app`
- ðŸš§ Custom domain configuration (pending - would require DNS setup)
- ðŸš§ Frontend-backend communication testing (requires live testing)
- ðŸš§ Authentication flow end-to-end testing (requires user interaction)
- ðŸš§ Speech recording functionality (requires browser permissions)
- âœ… Static file serving and nginx configuration working
