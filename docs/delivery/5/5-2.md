# [5-2] Implement System Integration Tests

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create comprehensive integration tests for voice workflows with OPAQUE authentication to ensure end-to-end system functionality. This task focuses on validating that all system components work together correctly with the new OPAQUE authentication system.

## Requirements

1. **Voice Workflow Integration Tests**
   - Test voice recording with OPAQUE secret tag authentication
   - Test transcription processing with authenticated sessions
   - Test entry creation and storage with encrypted content

2. **User Authentication Flow Tests**
   - Test user registration with OPAQUE protocol
   - Test user login and session management
   - Test session timeout and renewal

3. **Cross-Platform Integration Tests**
   - Test React Native frontend with FastAPI backend
   - Test mobile device compatibility
   - Test web browser compatibility

4. **Error Handling Integration Tests**
   - Test authentication failure scenarios
   - Test network connectivity issues
   - Test service recovery and retry mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup (4 hours)
1. **Test Environment Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // Test configuration for integration tests
   const integrationTestConfig = {
     backend: 'http://localhost:8000',
     database: 'test_opaque_db',
     testUsers: ['test_user_1', 'test_user_2'],
     testSecretTags: ['work', 'personal', 'health']
   };
   ```

2. **Test Data Setup**
   - Create test user accounts with OPAQUE registration
   - Generate test voice recordings
   - Set up test secret tags and encrypted entries

### Phase 2: Voice Workflow Integration Tests (6 hours)
1. **Complete Voice Recording Workflow**
   ```typescript
   describe('Voice Recording Integration', () => {
     test('Record voice → Detect secret tag → Authenticate → Create encrypted entry');
     test('Record voice → No secret tag → Create regular entry');
     test('Record voice → Authentication failure → Handle gracefully');
   });
   ```

2. **Entry Management Integration**
   - Test entry editing with OPAQUE authentication
   - Test entry deletion with proper authorization
   - Test entry search and filtering

### Phase 3: Authentication Flow Integration Tests (4 hours)
1. **User Registration and Login**
   ```typescript
   describe('Authentication Integration', () => {
     test('User registration → OPAQUE setup → First login');
     test('Existing user login → Session creation → API access');
     test('Session timeout → Re-authentication → Restored access');
   });
   ```

2. **Session Management**
   - Test concurrent sessions handling
   - Test session isolation between users
   - Test session security and encryption

### Phase 4: Cross-Platform Integration Tests (4 hours)
1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Test React Native client with FastAPI server
   - Test API request/response handling
   - Test real-time communication

2. **Mobile Device Testing**
   - Test on iOS simulator/device
   - Test on Android simulator/device
   - Test performance on different device specifications

## Test Plan

### Integration Test Categories

1. **End-to-End Voice Workflow Tests**
   - **Objective**: Validate complete voice recording and processing workflow
   - **Scope**: Voice recording → Speech-to-text → Secret tag detection → OPAQUE authentication → Entry creation
   - **Environment**: Full system with all services running
   - **Success Criteria**: Complete workflow executes without errors in <2 seconds

2. **Authentication Integration Tests**
   - **Objective**: Validate OPAQUE authentication integration with all system components
   - **Scope**: User registration, login, session management, API access
   - **Environment**: Frontend + Backend + Database
   - **Success Criteria**: Authentication completes in <500ms, sessions properly managed

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Tests**
   - **Objective**: Ensure system works correctly across different platforms
   - **Scope**: React Native iOS/Android, Web browser compatibility
   - **Environment**: Multiple platform test environments
   - **Success Criteria**: Consistent behavior across all supported platforms

4. **Error Handling Integration Tests**
   - **Objective**: Validate system resilience and error recovery
   - **Scope**: Network failures, authentication errors, service outages
   - **Environment**: Test environment with simulated failures
   - **Success Criteria**: Graceful error handling, proper user feedback

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path Scenarios**
   - New user registration and first secret tag creation
   - Existing user login and voice recording
   - Secret tag authentication and encrypted entry creation
   - Entry editing and management

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Network connectivity issues during authentication
   - Invalid secret tag authentication attempts
   - Session timeout during voice recording
   - Service unavailability and recovery

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Concurrent user sessions
   - Large voice recordings
   - Multiple secret tags in single recording
   - Rapid successive authentication attempts

## Verification
