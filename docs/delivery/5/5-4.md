## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Performance Testing Infrastructure (4 hours)
1. **Benchmarking Framework Setup**
   ```typescript
   class PerformanceBenchmark {
     async measureAuthenticationLatency(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics> {
       const startTime = performance.now();
       await authenticateWithOPAQUE();
       const endTime = performance.now();
       return { latency: endTime - startTime };
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Mobile Device Testing Setup**
   - Configure performance monitoring on iOS
   - Set up Android performance profiling
   - Implement battery usage measurement
   - Create memory usage tracking

### Phase 2: Authentication Performance Testing (6 hours)
1. **OPAQUE Performance Benchmarks**
   ```typescript
   describe('OPAQUE Performance', () => {
     test('Registration completes within 1000ms');
     test('Authentication completes within 500ms');
     test('Session creation within 100ms');
     test('Key derivation within 200ms');
   });
   ```

2. **Performance Profiling**
   - CPU usage during authentication
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Network request optimization
   - Cryptographic operation timing

### Phase 3: Mobile Performance Testing (6 hours)
1. **Device-Specific Benchmarks**
   ```typescript
   describe('Mobile Performance', () => {
     test('iPhone 12: Authentication <500ms');
     test('Samsung Galaxy S21: Authentication <500ms');
     test('Older devices: Authentication <1000ms');
     test('Battery impact <1% per hour');
   });
   ```

2. **Resource Usage Analysis**
   - Memory footprint measurement
   - Battery consumption tracking
   - CPU utilization monitoring
   - Storage usage analysis

### Phase 4: End-to-End Performance Testing (4 hours)
1. **Voice Workflow Performance**
   ```typescript
   describe('Voice Workflow Performance', () => {
     test('Complete voice recording workflow <2000ms');
     test('Speech-to-text processing <1500ms');
     test('Entry creation and encryption <300ms');
     test('UI responsiveness maintained throughout');
   });
   ```

2. **System Load Testing**
