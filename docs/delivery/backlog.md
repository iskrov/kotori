## Product Backlog

| ID | Actor | User Story | Status | Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) |
|----|-------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| PBI-4 | Developer/QA Engineer | As a developer, I want to systematically resolve all identified issues in the OPAQUE security system so that it is production-ready with full test coverage and no critical bugs | Done | [View Details](./4/prd.md) |
| PBI-1 | Developer/Security Engineer | As a security engineer, I want to implement OPAQUE cryptographic foundation so that the system can provide true zero-knowledge authentication without server-side knowledge of secret phrases | Done | [View Details](./1/prd.md) |
| PBI-2 | Backend Developer | As a backend developer, I want to implement clean OPAQUE server infrastructure so that the system uses only zero-knowledge authentication without legacy code | Done | [View Details](./2/prd.md) |
| PBI-3 | Frontend Developer | As a frontend developer, I want to integrate OPAQUE authentication with the voice journaling workflow so that users can seamlessly authenticate secret tags through voice commands | Done | [View Details](./3/prd.md) |
| PBI-6 | Security Engineer | As a security engineer, I want to implement advanced security hardening features so that the system resists traffic analysis and provides duress protection | Proposed | [View Details](./6/prd.md) |
| PBI-5 | DevOps Engineer/QA | As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement comprehensive testing and clean up legacy code so that the system uses only OPAQUE-based authentication | Proposed | [View Details](./5/prd.md) |
