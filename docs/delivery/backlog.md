## Product Backlog

| ID | Actor | User Story | Status | Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) |
|----|-------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| PBI-1 | Developer/Security Engineer | As a security engineer, I want to implement OPAQUE cryptographic foundation so that the system can provide true zero-knowledge authentication without server-side knowledge of secret phrases | Agreed | [View Details](./1/prd.md) |
| PBI-2 | Backend Developer | As a backend developer, I want to implement zero-knowledge server infrastructure so that the server can authenticate users without storing any secret information | Proposed | [View Details](./2/prd.md) |
| PBI-3 | Frontend Developer | As a frontend developer, I want to integrate OPAQUE authentication with the voice journaling workflow so that users can seamlessly authenticate secret tags through voice commands | Proposed | [View Details](./3/prd.md) |
| PBI-4 | Security Engineer | As a security engineer, I want to implement advanced security hardening features so that the system resists traffic analysis and provides duress protection | Proposed | [View Details](./4/prd.md) |
| PBI-5 | DevOps Engineer/QA | As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement comprehensive testing and migration tools so that existing users can safely migrate to the new OPAQUE system | Proposed | [View Details](./5/prd.md) |
