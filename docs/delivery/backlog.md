## Product Backlog

| ID | Actor | User Story | Status | Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) |
|----|-------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| PBI-9 | Developer | As a developer, I want to implement a clean, standardized database schema with consistent UUID primary keys across all models so that we have a solid foundation for scalability, performance, and maintainability | InProgress | All core models use native UUID primary keys, all foreign keys have proper indexes, legacy integer primary keys are eliminated, application code is updated to handle UUIDs consistently, and comprehensive test coverage validates the new schema | [View Details](./9/prd.md) |
| PBI-7 | User | As a user, I want to access my encrypted entries by typing secret phrases in journal entries so that I can retrieve private content without separate authentication flows | Proposed | Server-side phrase detection must work accurately, OPAQUE authentication must verify phrases without storing secrets, and encrypted entries must be returned immediately upon successful authentication | [View Details](./7/prd.md) |
| PBI-4 | Developer/QA Engineer | As a developer, I want to systematically resolve all identified issues in the OPAQUE security system so that it is production-ready with full test coverage and no critical bugs | Done | [View Details](./4/prd.md) |
| PBI-1 | Developer/Security Engineer | As a security engineer, I want to implement OPAQUE cryptographic foundation so that the system can provide true zero-knowledge authentication without server-side knowledge of secret phrases | Done | [View Details](./1/prd.md) |
| PBI-2 | Backend Developer | As a backend developer, I want to implement clean OPAQUE server infrastructure so that the system uses only zero-knowledge authentication without legacy code | Done | [View Details](./2/prd.md) |
| PBI-3 | Frontend Developer | As a frontend developer, I want to integrate OPAQUE authentication with the voice journaling workflow so that users can seamlessly authenticate secret tags through voice commands | Done | [View Details](./3/prd.md) |
| PBI-6 | Security Engineer | As a security engineer, I want to implement advanced security hardening features so that the system resists traffic analysis and provides duress protection | Proposed | [View Details](./6/prd.md) |
| PBI-5 | DevOps Engineer/QA | As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement comprehensive testing and clean up legacy code so that the system uses only OPAQUE-based authentication | Proposed | [View Details](./5/prd.md) |
| PBI-8 | Developer | As a developer, I want to standardize and optimize the database schema following Postgres best practices so that we have a solid foundation for scalability and cloud migration | Proposed | All models use consistent native UUID types where appropriate, proper indexes and constraints are added, Alembic migrations are set up, and cloud compatibility is documented | [View Details](./8/prd.md) |
