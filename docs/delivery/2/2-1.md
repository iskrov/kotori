# [2-1] Design Clean OPAQUE Database Schema

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Design and implement clean database schema for OPAQUE-based zero-knowledge authentication system, completely replacing the legacy V2 authentication system. This task creates the foundational database structure that stores OPAQUE verifiers, wrapped keys, and encrypted vault blobs while ensuring zero-knowledge properties are maintained and all legacy code is removed.

2. **backend/app/models/user.py** - Updated to use clean OPAQUE relationships
3. **backend/app/models/__init__.py** - Updated model exports
4. **backend/migrations/versions/001_create_opaque_v3_schema.py** - Clean database schema migration

## Implementation Summary

Successfully designed and implemented the clean OPAQUE database schema with the following key features:

### Core Tables Created

1. **secret_tags**: Clean OPAQUE verifiers and envelopes (replacing legacy tables)
2. **wrapped_keys**: AES-KW wrapped data encryption keys for vault access
3. **vault_blobs**: Encrypted content blobs with proper metadata
4. **opaque_sessions**: OPAQUE authentication session management

### Security Properties Achieved

- **Deterministic Tag IDs**: 16-byte tag IDs derived from Hash(phrase)
- **Proper Key Wrapping**: AES-KW wrapped keys (40 bytes)
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data properly encrypted
- **Session Isolation**: Secure session management with expiration

### Performance Characteristics

- **Efficient Indexing**: Optimized indexes for common query patterns
