# [2-5] Implement Vault Blob Storage

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement secure vault blob storage endpoints that allow authenticated users to store and retrieve encrypted content in their vaults. This system provides the core storage functionality for journal entries and other sensitive data, using the vault keys obtained through OPAQUE authentication to encrypt/decrypt content client-side.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Vault Blob Schema and Models

   - Verify relationships with WrappedKey and SecretTag
   - Ensure proper indexing for performance

2. **Blob Metadata Management**
   - Content type detection and validation
   - Size tracking and quota enforcement
   - Creation/modification timestamps
   - Object ID generation and uniqueness

### Phase 2: Vault Authentication and Authorization
1. **Session Token Validation**
   - Integrate with OPAQUE authentication from task 2-4
   - Verify session tokens and extract user/vault context
   - Implement vault ownership verification
   - Handle token expiration gracefully

2. **Vault Access Control**
   - Verify user owns the vault being accessed
   - Check vault exists and is accessible
   - Implement proper error responses for unauthorized access
   - Support future vault sharing capabilities

### Phase 3: Blob Storage Operations
1. **Blob Upload Implementation**
   - Accept encrypted blob content via multipart upload
   - Generate unique object IDs
   - Store blob metadata in database
   - Implement content size limits and validation

2. **Blob Retrieval Implementation**
   - Efficient blob content streaming
   - Support for partial content requests (HTTP Range)
   - Proper caching headers (ETag, Last-Modified)
   - Content type handling

### Phase 4: Vault Management Endpoints
1. **Blob Listing and Search**
   - Paginated blob listing with metadata
   - Filtering by content type, date range
   - Search capabilities for future enhancement
   - Efficient database queries

2. **Vault Statistics and Management**
   - Calculate vault usage statistics
   - Implement storage quotas
   - Bulk operations support
   - Vault maintenance operations

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that vault blob storage endpoints correctly handle encrypted content storage/retrieval, provide proper authentication/authorization, and maintain data integrity and security.

**Test Scope**: Blob upload/download, vault access control, content encryption handling, performance characteristics, and error scenarios.

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Successful Blob Operations**
   - Upload encrypted blob to authenticated vault
   - Retrieve blob content with proper metadata
   - List blobs in vault with pagination
   - Delete blob and verify removal

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Reject requests without valid session tokens
   - Prevent access to vaults not owned by user
   - Handle expired session tokens gracefully
   - Verify vault ownership for all operations

3. **Content Handling**
