# [2-7] Create OPAQUE Service Layer

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement a comprehensive OPAQUE service layer that provides business logic for OPAQUE operations, key management, and high-level abstractions for the OPAQUE zero-knowledge authentication system. This service will act as the primary interface between the API endpoints and the underlying OPAQUE cryptographic operations, providing a clean separation of concerns and centralized business logic.
