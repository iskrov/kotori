# [2-2] Remove Legacy Authentication Code

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Remove all legacy V1/V2 authentication code and database tables, replacing them entirely with the clean OPAQUE-based system. This task ensures the codebase contains only OPAQUE authentication, eliminating maintenance burden and potential security vulnerabilities from legacy code.

- ⚠️ Legacy table cleanup pending

#### Voice Workflow Integration
- ✅ Speech endpoint updated for OPAQUE models
