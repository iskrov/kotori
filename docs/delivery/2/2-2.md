## Requirements
- Guard TagManagement screen route.
- Guard SecretTag indicators and controls.
- Ensure recorder/transcription flows work without tag logic.

## Implementation Plan
- Wrap routing and components with `areSecretTagsEnabled()`.

## Verification
- No visible secret-tag UI when flag OFF.
- Tag routes/components render `null` and detectors are skipped.
- Existing journaling/transcription flows unaffected.

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/*` (secret-tag related)
- `frontend/src/screens/main/RecordScreen.tsx`
- `frontend/src/services/speechToText.ts`
