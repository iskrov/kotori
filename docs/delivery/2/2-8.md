# [2-8] Implement Security Audit Logging

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive security audit logging for OPAQUE authentication events and system operations while maintaining zero-knowledge properties. This system will provide detailed audit trails for security monitoring, compliance, and incident investigation without exposing sensitive information or compromising the zero-knowledge architecture.
