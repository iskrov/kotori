# PBI-6: Security Hardening and Traffic Analysis Resistance

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-PBI-6)

## Overview

Implement advanced security hardening features including traffic analysis resistance, duress protection, memory security, and cover traffic generation. This PBI ensures the OPAQUE system provides maximum security against sophisticated attacks and coercion scenarios.

## Problem Statement

Even with OPAQUE zero-knowledge authentication, the system remains vulnerable to advanced attacks:
- Traffic analysis can reveal when secret authentication attempts occur
- Memory attacks could recover sensitive keys from RAM
- Timing attacks might leak information about authentication success/failure
- Coercion scenarios require panic modes and plausible deniability features
- Side-channel attacks could compromise cryptographic operations

This PBI implements comprehensive security hardening to protect against these advanced threat vectors.

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a security engineer, I want to implement advanced security hardening features so that the system resists traffic analysis and provides duress protection.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a journalist, I want panic mode functionality so that I can quickly destroy all secret data under duress
- As a security researcher, I want traffic analysis resistance so that network monitoring cannot reveal my secret usage patterns
- As a privacy advocate, I want memory security so that forensic analysis cannot recover my encryption keys
- As a user in hostile environments, I want fake vault support so that I can provide decoy data under coercion

## Technical Approach

### Traffic Analysis Resistance

1. **Cover Traffic Generation**
   ```typescript
   class CoverTrafficManager {
     private generateDummyAuthentications() {
       // Periodic dummy OPAQUE authentication attempts
       // Random timing patterns to obscure real usage
       // Uniform request sizes and response patterns
     }
     
     private batchOperations() {
       // Batch multiple operations together
       // Add padding to normalize request sizes
       // Implement request queueing and timing
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Request Obfuscation**
   - Uniform timing for all authentication requests
   - Constant-size request/response padding
   - Decoy requests for failed authentications
   - Background noise generation

### Memory Security

1. **Secure Key Management**
   ```typescript
   class SecureMemoryManager {
     private sensitiveData = new Map<string, SecureBuffer>();
     
     allocateSecure(size: number): SecureBuffer {
       // Allocate memory with secure erasure
       // Prevent memory dumps and swapping
       // Automatic cleanup on timeout
     }
     
     clearAll(): void {
       // Zero-out all sensitive memory
       // Force garbage collection
       // Verify memory has been cleared
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Timing Attack Protection**
   - Constant-time cryptographic operations
   - Random delays for authentication responses
   - Uniform processing time regardless of success/failure

### Duress Protection

1. **Panic Mode**
   ```typescript
   class PanicModeManager {
     async activatePanicMode(): Promise<void> {
       // Immediately clear all session keys
       // Delete OPAQUE client state
       // Clear application cache and storage
       // Optional: Delete secret tag registrations
     }
     
     detectDuressPatterns(): boolean {
       // Unusual access patterns
       // Biometric anomalies (future)
       // Time-based triggers
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Fake Vault Support**
   - Register decoy secret tags with benign content
   - Plausible deniability through fake data
   - Multiple duress phrases for different scenarios

### Side-Channel Resistance

1. **Cryptographic Hardening**
   - Constant-time implementations for all crypto operations
   - Protection against power analysis attacks
   - Resistance to cache timing attacks

2. **Environmental Security**
   - Screen recording detection and prevention
   - Keylogger resistance for sensitive operations
   - Anti-debugging and tamper detection

## UX/UI Considerations

- **Transparent Operation**: Security features should be invisible to normal users
- **Emergency Access**: Panic mode must be quickly accessible in crisis situations
- **Configuration**: Advanced users should be able to configure security parameters
- **Performance**: Security features must not noticeably impact app performance
- **Accessibility**: Security features must work with accessibility tools

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Traffic Analysis Resistance**
   - [ ] Cover traffic generates indistinguishable dummy authentication requests
   - [ ] Request timing is uniform regardless of authentication success/failure
   - [ ] Network monitoring cannot distinguish real from dummy operations
   - [ ] Batch operations obscure individual authentication patterns

2. **Memory Security**
   - [ ] All sensitive keys automatically cleared within 1 second of session end
   - [ ] Memory leak detection passes for all cryptographic operations
   - [ ] Forensic memory analysis cannot recover encryption keys
   - [ ] Secure memory allocation prevents key recovery from memory dumps

3. **Duress Protection**
   - [ ] Panic mode destroys all secret data within 2 seconds
   - [ ] Fake vault support provides plausible deniability
   - [ ] Multiple duress scenarios supported with different responses
   - [ ] Emergency phrase detection works reliably under stress

4. **Side-Channel Resistance**
   - [ ] Timing attack resistance verified through statistical analysis
   - [ ] Constant-time operations implemented for all crypto functions
   - [ ] Power analysis resistance tested on mobile devices
   - [ ] Cache timing attacks mitigated through implementation review

## Dependencies

- **PBI-1**: OPAQUE cryptographic foundation
- **PBI-2**: Zero-knowledge server infrastructure  
- **PBI-3**: OPAQUE client integration
- **Security Testing**: Specialized tools for side-channel analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to measure security feature impact

## Open Questions

1. **Cover Traffic Frequency**: How often should dummy authentication requests be generated to provide effective cover?
2. **Panic Mode Scope**: Should panic mode delete only session data or also registered secret tags on the server?
3. **Performance Impact**: What is the acceptable performance overhead for security hardening features?
4. **Fake Vault Content**: What type of decoy content provides the most plausible deniability?
