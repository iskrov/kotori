# [1-4] Implement Secure Memory Management

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Enhance and extend the secure memory management utilities for OPAQUE zero-knowledge authentication. While basic secure memory functionality was implemented in task 1-2, this task focuses on advanced security features including memory locking, secure key storage, automatic cleanup mechanisms, and protection against memory dumps and side-channel attacks. This ensures that sensitive cryptographic material never persists in memory longer than necessary.
