# [1-6] Create OPAQUE Client Integration

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Integrate the OPAQUE library with the frontend authentication flow to enable zero-knowledge password-based authentication. This task involves creating client-side components that handle OPAQUE protocol messages, manage authentication state, and provide a seamless user experience for registration and login while maintaining the zero-knowledge properties that prevent the server from learning user passwords or derived keys.
