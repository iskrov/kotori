# [1-1] Research and Select OPAQUE Library

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research and evaluate available OPAQUE (Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions) implementations for JavaScript/TypeScript to select the most suitable library for the Vibes zero-knowledge authentication system. The selected library must provide RFC compliance, security audit status, performance suitable for mobile devices, and active maintenance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **RFC Compliance**: Library must implement OPAQUE protocol according to draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-18 or later
2. **Platform Support**: Must work on React Native (iOS/Android) and Node.js backend
3. **TypeScript Support**: Must provide TypeScript definitions or be written in TypeScript
4. **Security Audit**: Prefer libraries with documented security audits or formal verification
5. **Performance**: Must complete authentication flow in <500ms on mobile devices

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Maintenance**: Active development with commits within last 6 months
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
3. **License**: Compatible with commercial use (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)
4. **Size**: Reasonable bundle size impact for mobile applications
5. **Dependencies**: Minimal dependency tree to reduce attack surface

### Research Criteria
1. **Library Candidates**: Evaluate @stablelib/opaque, opaque-wasm, custom implementations
2. **Security Properties**: Verify cryptographic security guarantees
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Test key operations on target mobile devices
4. **Integration Complexity**: Assess ease of integration with existing codebase
5. **Community Support**: Evaluate GitHub stars, issues, and community activity

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Library Discovery and Initial Evaluation (2 days)
1. **Identify Candidates**
   - Search npm registry for OPAQUE implementations
   - Review academic implementations and research papers
   - Check crypto library collections (libsodium, noble-crypto, etc.)

2. **Initial Screening**
   - Verify RFC compliance claims
   - Check maintenance status and recent activity
   - Review documentation quality
   - Assess TypeScript support

### Phase 2: Deep Technical Evaluation (3 days)
1. **Security Analysis**
   - Review implementation for side-channel resistance
   - Check for security audit reports or formal verification
   - Analyze cryptographic primitive usage
   - Verify constant-time operations where required

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Create benchmark test suite for key operations
   - Test on iOS and Android devices (low-end and high-end)
   - Measure memory usage and battery impact
   - Compare performance across candidates

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Create proof-of-concept integration with React Native
   - Test backend integration with FastAPI/Python
   - Verify cross-platform compatibility
   - Test bundle size impact

### Phase 3: Final Selection and Documentation (1 day)
1. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
   - Document trade-offs and recommendations
   - Prepare fallback options if primary choice fails

2. **Implementation Guide**
   - Create integration guide for selected library
   - Document configuration parameters
   - Prepare example code snippets
   - Identify potential issues and mitigations

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that the selected OPAQUE library meets all functional and non-functional requirements for the Vibes application.

**Test Scope**: Library evaluation, performance benchmarking, and integration testing.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **RFC Compliance Verification**
   - Verify OPAQUE protocol implementation matches specification
   - Test interoperability with reference implementations
   - Validate cryptographic primitives usage

2. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Measure authentication flow completion time on mobile devices
   - Test memory usage during key operations
   - Verify battery impact is acceptable

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test React Native integration on iOS and Android
   - Verify Node.js backend compatibility
   - Test TypeScript type safety and developer experience

4. **Security Validation**
   - Review implementation for timing attacks
   - Verify secure memory handling
   - Test error handling and failure modes

**Success Criteria**:
- Authentication flow completes in <500ms on target mobile devices
- Library integrates successfully with React Native and Node.js
- TypeScript support provides full type safety
- Security properties meet or exceed current Argon2 implementation
- Documentation is sufficient for team implementation

**Environment & Setup**: 
- Development environment with React Native and Node.js
- Test devices: iOS (iPhone 12), Android (Samsung Galaxy A52)
- Performance monitoring tools and profilers

## Research Results

### Selected Library: @serenity-kit/opaque

**Decision Rationale:**
After comprehensive evaluation of available OPAQUE implementations, `@serenity-kit/opaque` is the clear choice for our implementation.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **Security Audited**: Professional security audit by 7ASecurity (OTF Red Team Lab)
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Used in production by Serenity encrypted workspaces
- ✅ **RFC Compliant**: Implements draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-18 specification
- ✅ **TypeScript Native**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Node.js, browser, and React Native support available
- ✅ **Well-Funded**: Netidee funding ensures long-term maintenance
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs with interactive examples at opaque-auth.com

**Comparison with Alternatives:**
- **Cloudflare CIRCL**: Excellent but Go-focused, limited JS bindings
- **@47ng/opaque**: Adequate but smaller community and limited documentation
- **libopaque**: Outdated (4 years), alpha status, no TypeScript support

### Implementation Readiness

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Bundle Size**: Reasonable WebAssembly footprint
- **Performance**: Configurable Argon2id key stretching for mobile optimization
- **API Design**: Modern async/await patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states for authentication flows

**Integration Path:**
1. Install via npm: `@serenity-kit/opaque`
2. Generate secure server setup for dev/prod environments
3. Implement registration and login flows per documented patterns
4. Configure key stretching parameters for mobile performance
5. Integrate with existing authentication middleware
