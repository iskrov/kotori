# [1-8] Implement Cross-Platform Testing

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive test suite for the OPAQUE cryptographic system that validates functionality across different platforms (web browser, iOS, Android, and backend server). This task ensures that the OPAQUE implementation works consistently across all target platforms and that the client-server communication is properly tested end-to-end.
