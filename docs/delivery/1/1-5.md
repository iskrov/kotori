# [1-5] Implement AES-KW Key Wrapping

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) functionality for secure protection of vault data keys in the OPAQUE zero-knowledge system. AES-KW provides authenticated encryption for cryptographic keys, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity. This implementation will be used to protect vault data encryption keys using the derived encryption keys (Ke) from the OPAQUE protocol, enabling secure storage of encrypted journal entries without server-side knowledge of the plaintext.
