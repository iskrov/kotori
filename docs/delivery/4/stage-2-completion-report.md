# PBI-4 Stage 2 Completion Report

## Secret-Tag Schema Destructive Removal

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Migration**: `a1b2c3d4e5f6_stage_2_remove_secret_tag_schema`

## Summary

Stage 2 of PBI-4 has been successfully completed. All legacy secret-tag schema objects have been destructively removed from the database and codebase. The application continues to operate normally with per-user encryption for journal entries.

## What Was Removed

### Database Objects
- ✅ `secret_tags` table and all indexes/constraints
- ✅ `wrapped_keys` table and all indexes/constraints  
- ✅ `vault_blobs` table and all indexes/constraints
- ✅ `tag_sessions` table and all indexes/constraints
- ✅ `journal_entries.secret_tag_id` column and related indexes
- ✅ All foreign key constraints referencing secret-tag tables

### Code Components
- ✅ `app/models/secret_tag_opaque.py` - ORM models file
- ✅ `app/services/secret_tag_service.py` - Service layer
- ✅ `app/api/v1/secret_tags.py` - API router
- ✅ Secret-tag related imports from `app/models/__init__.py`
- ✅ Secret-tag relationships from User and JournalEntry models
- ✅ Secret-tag router registration from main.py

### Services Status After Stage 2
- ✅ OPAQUE User Service (`opaque_user_service.py`): RESTORED (OPAQUE user auth is critical and now decoupled from secret-tags)
- ✅ Session Service (`session_service.py`): RESTORED for OPAQUE sessions
- ❌ Vault Service (`vault_service.py`): DISABLED (relied on secret-tag vaults)
- ❌ Audit Service (`audit_service.py`): DISABLED (relied on removed models)
- ❌ Phrase Processor (`phrase_processor.py`): DISABLED (secret-tag feature)
- ❌ Entry Processor (`entry_processor.py`): DISABLED (secret-tag feature)

## Migration Details

**Migration File**: `backend/migrations/versions/a1b2c3d4e5f6_stage_2_remove_secret_tag_schema.py`

### Safe Removal Order
1. Drop foreign key constraints referencing secret_tags
2. Drop dependent tables: tag_sessions, vault_blobs, wrapped_keys
3. Drop journal_entries.secret_tag_id column and indexes
4. Drop secret_tags table with CASCADE

### Downgrade Support
The migration includes a complete downgrade path that recreates all removed objects with their original schema structure. **Note**: Downgrade will recreate empty tables - data is not restored.

## Verification Results

### ✅ Application Startup
- Backend starts successfully without errors
- Disabled services log appropriate warnings
- No import errors or missing model references

### ✅ Core Functionality  
- Health endpoint responds correctly
- OPAQUE authentication restored and working (registration/login)
- Journal entry creation/retrieval works with per-user encryption
- Secret-tag endpoints properly return 404 (removed)

### ✅ Database State
- Migration applied successfully: `a1b2c3d4e5f6 (head)`
- All legacy secret-tag tables confirmed removed
- Application operates without database errors

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ No Impact Areas
- **Per-user encryption**: Journal entries continue to use per-user encryption fields
- **Authentication**: Standard JWT-based auth continues to work
- **Core journal operations**: Create, read, update, delete all functional
- **User management**: User registration, login, profile management unaffected

### ⚠️ Disabled Functionality
- **Secret phrase processing**: Removed
- **Vault storage**: Disabled
- **Security audit logging**: Disabled (basic logging still works)

## Rollback Strategy

If rollback is needed:

1. **Database Rollback**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   conda run -n kotori alembic downgrade f0d9b1c3f4a1
   ```

2. **Code Rollback**:
   - Restore deleted model files from git history
   - Restore disabled service implementations
   - Re-enable secret-tag router in main.py
   - Update model imports and relationships

3. **Re-enable Feature Flag**:
   ```bash
   # In backend/.env
   ENABLE_SECRET_TAGS=true
   ```

## Future Considerations

### Cleanup Opportunities
- Remove unused OPAQUE-related dependencies from requirements.txt
- Remove disabled service files if functionality is confirmed unneeded
- Clean up any remaining secret-tag references in tests/documentation

### Architecture Improvements
- Consider implementing proper session management if needed (without OPAQUE dependency)
- Evaluate need for audit logging and implement with simpler approach if required
- Review encryption architecture for potential simplifications

## Conclusion

✅ **PBI-4 Stage 2 successfully completed**

The legacy secret-tag schema has been completely and safely removed from the Kotori application. The app continues to operate normally with per-user encryption for journal entries. All core functionality remains intact while unused experimental features have been properly disabled.

The destructive removal was executed safely with:
- ✅ Comprehensive testing before and after removal
- ✅ Complete rollback migration available
- ✅ No impact on core user-facing functionality
- ✅ Clean error handling for disabled features

The application is now in a cleaner, more maintainable state with reduced complexity around unused secret-tag functionality.
