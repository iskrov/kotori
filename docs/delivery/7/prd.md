# PBI-7: Server-Side Secret Phrase Authentication

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-PBI-7)

## Overview

Implement server-side secret phrase authentication that detects secret phrases in journal entry content during submission and provides access to encrypted entries using OPAQUE zero-knowledge authentication. This approach ensures true zero-knowledge security with no client-side secret storage while maintaining a simple user experience.

## Problem Statement

Users need the ability to access private encrypted entries by including secret phrases directly in their journal entry content:
- Users should be able to write entries containing exact secret phrases (e.g., "my secret work phrase")
- The server must detect these phrases during entry submission without storing the actual phrases
- Authentication must use the existing OPAQUE infrastructure for zero-knowledge verification
- Upon successful authentication, users should gain access to all entries encrypted with that secret tag
- No client-side secret storage or session management should be required

The implementation must leverage the existing OPAQUE foundation while providing a seamless user experience through the journal entry submission flow.

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a user, I want to access my private encrypted entries by typing my secret phrase in a journal entry so that I can retrieve my secret content without separate authentication steps.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to type "my secret work phrase" as a secret phrase in an entry to access all my work-related encrypted entries
- As a security-conscious user, I want my secret phrases processed server-side so that no secrets are stored on my device
- As a user, I want the system to automatically detect secret phrases in my entries so that I don't need separate authentication flows
- As a user, I want to be able to access my encrypted entries by speaking my secret phrase so that I can use voice input for convenience
- As a user, I want to be able to access my encrypted entries by typing my secret phrase so that I can use keyboard input for convenience
- As a developer, I want to leverage existing OPAQUE infrastructure so that implementation is secure and efficient
- As a user, I want immediate access to my encrypted entries after entering a valid secret phrase

**Critical Security User Stories:**
- As a user, when I enter only a secret phrase (Password Entry), I want the system to authenticate me but NOT save the phrase to the database to maintain maximum security
- As a user, when I enter mixed content with a secret phrase, I want the system to save the non-secret content while using the secret phrase for authentication
- As a user, when I enter regular content without secret phrases, I want the system to save it normally without any authentication attempts
- As a security-conscious user, I want explicit control over what content gets saved to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information

        return await self.save_regular_entry(content, user_id)
```

### Security Architecture

#### Production-Ready Security Measures:
1. **Constant-Time Operations**: All phrase comparisons use constant-time algorithms
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks on phrase authentication
3. **Secure Memory Management**: Clear sensitive data from memory after use
4. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Track all authentication attempts and access patterns
5. **Cross-Platform Security**: Proper keystore usage on mobile platforms

#### Zero-Knowledge Properties:
- Server never stores actual secret phrases
- OPAQUE verifiers provide zero-knowledge authentication
- Deterministic TagID generation enables phrase lookup without revealing phrases
- Failed authentication provides no information about secret tag existence

### Implementation Components

The following components need to be implemented or enhanced to achieve full production readiness:

#### 1. **Production OPAQUE Server Library**
Replace the simplified implementation with a real OPAQUE library:
```python
# Priority: Critical - Core security dependency
class ProductionOpaqueService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.opaque_server = opaque_ke.ServerSession()  # Real OPAQUE V3 library
    
    def register_secret_phrase(self, phrase: str, user_id: int) -> RegistrationResult
    def authenticate_phrase(self, phrase: str, verifier: bytes) -> AuthenticationResult
    def handle_opaque_protocol(self, message: bytes) -> ProtocolResponse
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Speech Service with Database Integration**
Connect speech processing to the secret tags database:
```python
# Priority: High - Core functionality
class IntegratedSpeechService:
    async def process_speech_for_secret_phrases(self, audio_data: bytes, user_id: int) -> List[DetectedPhrase]
    async def transcribe_and_detect_phrases(self, audio_data: bytes) -> List[str]
    async def match_phrases_to_secret_tags(self, phrases: List[str], user_id: int) -> List[SecretTag]
```

#### 3. **Production JWT Session Manager**
Replace simple session tokens with proper JWT implementation:
```python
# Priority: Medium - Security enhancement
class JWTSessionManager:
    def create_session(self, user_id: int, secret_tag_id: str) -> str
    def validate_session(self, token: str) -> SessionValidation
    def refresh_session(self, token: str) -> str
    def revoke_session(self, token: str) -> bool
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Phrase Processing Service**
Complete the production-ready phrase processing with security measures:
```python
# Priority: High - Core functionality
class ProductionPhraseProcessor:
    def extract_normalized_phrases(self, content: str) -> List[str]
    def generate_tag_id_constant_time(self, phrase: str) -> bytes
    def validate_phrase_format(self, phrase: str) -> bool
    def secure_phrase_comparison(self, phrase1: str, phrase2: str) -> bool
```

#### 5. **Integrated Journal Entry Service**
Combine all components into a cohesive entry submission flow:
```python
# Priority: Critical - Main user-facing functionality
class SecretPhraseJournalService:
    async def create_entry_with_phrase_detection(self, content: str, user_id: int) -> JournalEntryResult
    async def authenticate_and_retrieve_entries(self, phrases: List[str], user_id: int) -> List[EncryptedEntry]
    async def save_regular_entry(self, content: str, user_id: int) -> JournalEntry
```

#### 6. **Comprehensive Security and Audit System**
Add production-ready security measures:
```python
# Priority: High - Production security
class SecurityAuditService:
    async def log_phrase_authentication_attempt(self, user_id: int, success: bool, timestamp: datetime)
    async def detect_brute_force_attempts(self, user_id: int) -> bool
    async def rate_limit_check(self, user_id: int, action: str) -> bool
    async def secure_memory_cleanup(self, sensitive_data: bytes) -> None
```
