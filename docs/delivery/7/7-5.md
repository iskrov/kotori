# [7-5] Implement secure entry submission flow with phrase detection

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Integrate phrase detection into journal entry creation with proper OPAQUE authentication and encrypted entry retrieval. This task implements the complete end-to-end flow where users save journal entries containing secret phrases, which automatically trigger secret tag authentication, encrypt the entry, and store it securely in the vault system. The implementation builds on the enhanced phrase processing service and production OPAQUE server to create a seamless, secure user experience.
