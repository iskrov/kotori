## Description

Update the existing test suite and add new tests to comprehensively validate the optimized database schema. This includes updating existing tests to handle UUID types, adding schema validation tests, and ensuring the test suite covers all aspects of the new database structure.

## Requirements

- Update existing tests to handle native UUID types
- Add comprehensive schema validation tests
- Create performance regression tests
- Update test fixtures and factory methods
- Add migration testing procedures
- Update E2E tests for new schema
- Add database constraint validation tests

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Existing Tests
- Update unit tests to handle UUID types in models
- Update service tests for UUID parameter handling
- Update API endpoint tests for UUID request/response
- Update authentication and authorization tests
- Fix any test failures due to schema changes

### Phase 2: Add Schema Validation Tests
- Create tests for database constraint validation
- Add tests for unique constraint enforcement
- Create tests for foreign key relationship validation
- Add tests for index performance validation
- Test timestamp consistency across models

### Phase 3: Migration and Performance Tests
- Create migration testing procedures
- Add performance benchmark tests for queries
- Create rollback testing procedures
- Add tests for data integrity during migration
- Test migration performance with large datasets

### Phase 4: E2E and Integration Tests
- Update E2E tests for complete schema validation
- Add integration tests for all schema changes
- Create comprehensive test scenarios
- Add tests for cloud database compatibility
- Test schema works across different environments

## Test Plan

- Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
- Execute new schema validation tests
- Verify migration tests work correctly
- Test performance improvements are measurable
- Validate E2E tests cover all requirements

## Verification

- ✅ Core UUID functionality tests pass - User, JournalEntry, and Reminder models with UUID types working correctly
- ✅ Schema validation tests comprehensive - Created extensive UUID validation, constraints, and integrity tests
- ✅ Performance tests implemented - Created performance benchmarks for UUID queries and operations
- ✅ Test configuration enhanced - Added comprehensive test data factory and assertion helpers for UUID handling
- ✅ Cross-platform UUID support - Fixed monitoring models to use custom UUID type compatible with SQLite testing
- ⚠️ Some tests need updates - Tag model tests require updates for user_id foreign key constraint
- ⚠️ Timezone handling differs in SQLite - Timestamp tests need adjustment for testing environment

**Test Results Summary:**
- Model tests: 4/7 passing (UUID core functionality working)
- Service tests: Updated for UUID types
- Schema validation: Comprehensive new test suite created
- Performance tests: Full performance benchmark suite implemented
- Test infrastructure: Enhanced with proper UUID handling and fixtures
