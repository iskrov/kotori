## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for migrating the optimized database schema to cloud Postgres instances like GCP Cloud SQL and AWS RDS. This includes migration procedures, cloud-specific optimizations, backup/restore procedures, and operational guidelines.

## Requirements

- Document cloud migration procedures for GCP Cloud SQL and AWS RDS
- Create backup and restore procedures for cloud databases
- Document cloud-specific optimizations and configurations
- Provide connection string and authentication guidance
- Document monitoring and maintenance procedures
- Create troubleshooting guide for cloud-specific issues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cloud Platform Analysis
- Research GCP Cloud SQL requirements and optimizations
- Research AWS RDS requirements and optimizations
- Analyze cloud-specific PostgreSQL features and limitations
- Document cloud provider differences and considerations

### Phase 2: Migration Procedures
- Create step-by-step migration procedures for each cloud platform
- Document database backup and restore procedures
- Create connection string and authentication configuration
- Document environment-specific configurations
- Create migration validation procedures

### Phase 3: Optimization and Configuration
- Document cloud-specific performance optimizations
- Create monitoring and alerting configurations
- Document scaling and maintenance procedures
- Create cost optimization guidelines
- Document security best practices for cloud databases

### Phase 4: Operations and Troubleshooting
- Create operational runbooks for cloud databases
- Document common issues and troubleshooting steps
- Create disaster recovery procedures
- Document performance monitoring and optimization
- Create maintenance and upgrade procedures

## Test Plan

- Validate migration procedures with test databases
- Test backup and restore procedures on cloud platforms
- Verify connection configurations work correctly
- Test monitoring and alerting configurations
- Validate disaster recovery procedures

## Verification

- ✅ Comprehensive cloud migration documentation created covering GCP Cloud SQL and AWS RDS
- ✅ Migration procedures documented with step-by-step instructions for multiple methods
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code configurations provided (Terraform) for both platforms
- ✅ Backup/restore procedures detailed with automation scripts and manual procedures
- ✅ Cloud-specific optimizations documented including performance tuning and cost optimization
- ✅ Security best practices documented with IAM, encryption, and network security
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting configurations provided for both platforms
- ✅ Operational procedures comprehensive including maintenance and troubleshooting
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide complete with common issues and solutions

## Files Created

- docs/delivery/8/cloud_migration_guide.md - Comprehensive 200+ section guide covering all aspects of cloud migration
- docs/delivery/8/gcp_cloud_sql_guide.md - GCP-specific guide with Terraform configs, DMS procedures, and operational setup
- docs/delivery/8/aws_rds_guide.md - AWS-specific guide with RDS configurations, IAM auth, and high availability setup

## Documentation Scope

**Platform Coverage:**
- Google Cloud Platform (Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL) with full operational procedures
- Amazon Web Services (RDS for PostgreSQL) with comprehensive configuration guides
