## Description

Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests to verify that the optimized database schema meets all Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) for PBI-8. This includes validating all schema optimizations, performance improvements, and ensuring the system works correctly end-to-end.

## Requirements

- Verify all ID fields are consistent (native UUID for users and related)
- Validate indexes are added to all foreign keys
- Confirm Alembic migrations work correctly
- Test cloud database compatibility
- Verify all tests pass with new schema
- Validate performance improvements are measurable

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CoS Validation Test Design
- Create test scenarios for each acceptance criterion
- Design comprehensive test coverage for all schema changes
- Create test data that exercises all schema features
- Plan test execution across multiple environments

### Phase 2: Schema Consistency Tests
- Test all ID fields use consistent native UUID types
- Verify foreign key relationships work correctly
- Test unique constraints prevent duplicate data
- Validate timestamp consistency across all models
- Test index performance and effectiveness

### Phase 3: Migration and Cloud Tests
- Test Alembic migrations work in all environments
- Validate rollback procedures work correctly
- Test schema compatibility with cloud databases
- Verify migration performance with large datasets
- Test data integrity throughout migration process

### Phase 4: End-to-End System Tests
- Test complete application functionality with new schema
- Verify all services work correctly with UUID types
- Test API endpoints handle UUID parameters correctly
- Validate authentication and authorization still work
- Test performance improvements are measurable

## Test Plan

- Execute comprehensive test suite covering all CoS
- Test schema changes in development, test, and staging environments
- Validate migration procedures work correctly
- Test cloud database compatibility
- Measure and document performance improvements

## Verification

- All acceptance criteria from PBI-8 PRD are met
- Schema optimizations deliver expected performance improvements
- Migration procedures work reliably across environments
- Cloud database compatibility confirmed
- Complete system functionality validated
