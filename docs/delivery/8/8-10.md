## Description

Conduct comprehensive performance testing to validate that the schema optimizations deliver the expected performance improvements. This includes benchmarking queries, measuring index effectiveness, and ensuring the optimized schema performs better than the original schema.

## Requirements

- Create performance benchmark tests for common query patterns
- Measure query performance improvements with new indexes
- Validate UUID type performance vs String(36) types
- Test database performance under load
- Measure index effectiveness and usage
- Document performance improvements and any regressions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Performance Benchmark Setup
- Create baseline performance measurements from current schema
- Set up performance testing infrastructure
- Create reproducible test datasets for benchmarking
- Define performance metrics and success criteria

### Phase 2: Query Performance Testing
- Benchmark common query patterns (user lookups, journal entries, tags)
- Test foreign key join performance with new UUID indexes
- Measure composite index effectiveness for common queries
- Test unique constraint performance impact
- Compare UUID vs String(36) query performance

### Phase 3: Load Testing
- Test database performance under concurrent load
- Measure scalability with large datasets
- Test migration performance with production-sized data
- Validate index performance doesn't degrade under load
- Test cloud database performance characteristics

### Phase 4: Analysis and Optimization
- Analyze performance test results
- Identify any performance regressions
- Document performance improvements achieved
- Provide recommendations for further optimization
- Create performance monitoring guidelines

## Test Plan

- Execute baseline performance tests on current schema
- Run performance tests on optimized schema
- Compare performance metrics before and after
- Validate performance improvements meet expectations
- Test performance across different environments

## Verification

- Query performance improvements measurable and documented
- Index effectiveness validated with real-world usage patterns
- No significant performance regressions introduced
- Database performs well under load
- Performance improvements meet acceptance criteria
