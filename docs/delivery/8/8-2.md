## Description

Design a comprehensive UUID migration strategy and implement it for the core User model, establishing the foundation for all other model migrations. This task focuses on the most critical model that all others reference.

## Requirements

- Design safe UUID migration strategy for existing data
- Update User model from String(36) to native UUID type
- Create data migration plan for existing user records
- Establish migration patterns for other models to follow
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Migration Strategy Design
- Analyze current User model and all its relationships
- Design UUID migration approach (in-place vs new table)
- Plan for foreign key constraint updates
- Create rollback procedures

### Phase 2: User Model Update
- Update User model to use native UUID from base.py
- Modify primary key from String(36) to UUID(as_uuid=True)
- Update all User model relationships and constraints
- Add proper indexing for UUID primary key

### Phase 3: Migration Script Creation
- Create Alembic migration script for User model
- Include data conversion from String(36) to UUID
- Add validation steps for migration success
- Test migration with sample data

## Test Plan

- Test User model creates/updates with new UUID type
- Verify foreign key relationships still work
- Test migration script with existing data
- Validate rollback procedures work correctly
- Ensure no data loss during migration

## Verification

- User model uses native UUID type consistently
- All existing user data migrated successfully
- Foreign key relationships maintained
- Migration and rollback procedures documented
- Performance improvements measurable
