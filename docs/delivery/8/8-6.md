## Description

Configure Alembic migration tool and create the foundation for all schema migrations. This includes setting up the migration environment, configuring database connections, and creating the initial migration structure for the optimized schema.

## Requirements

- Install and configure Alembic for the project
- Set up proper database connection configuration
- Create initial migration structure
- Configure migration environment for multiple environments (dev, test, prod)
- Establish migration best practices and procedures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Alembic Installation and Configuration
- Install Alembic package and dependencies
- Run `alembic init migrations` to create directory structure
- Configure alembic.ini with proper database URLs
- Set up env.py for SQLAlchemy model integration

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration
- Configure multiple environment support (dev, test, prod)
- Set up database URL configuration from environment variables
- Configure logging for migration operations
- Set up proper schema target metadata

### Phase 3: Initial Migration Setup
- Create baseline migration from current schema
- Generate migration template for upcoming changes
- Test migration and rollback procedures
- Document migration workflow and best practices

### Phase 4: Migration Validation
- Test migration on development database
- Validate migration rollback procedures
- Create migration testing procedures
- Document troubleshooting guide

## Test Plan

- Test Alembic installation and configuration
- Verify database connection works correctly
- Test migration creation and application
- Validate rollback procedures work
- Test migration in different environments

## Verification

✅ **Alembic properly installed and configured:**
- Package: `alembic==1.12.1` already in requirements.txt
- Directory structure: `migrations/` directory with proper structure
- Configuration: `alembic.ini` properly configured with logging and database URL override

✅ **Database migrations work correctly:**
- Current migration: `82afb2bd4286` (head)
- Migration chain: 5 migrations from initial to current state
- Migration commands: `alembic current`, `alembic history`, `alembic check` all working
- Auto-generation: Alembic detects model changes correctly

✅ **Rollback procedures tested and documented:**
- All migrations include both `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions
- Migration history properly tracked
- Rollback commands documented in guide

✅ **Migration environment supports dev/test/prod:**
- Database URL configured via `settings.DATABASE_URL`
- Environment variables supported for different environments
- PostgreSQL-specific configuration included

✅ **Migration workflow documented:**
- Created comprehensive `backend/docs/alembic_guide.md`
- Includes best practices, troubleshooting, and examples
- Documents all migration commands and procedures
- Includes security considerations and performance tips

✅ **Model imports fixed:**
- All models imported in `migrations/env.py` for proper autogeneration
- Includes all core models: User, JournalEntry, Tag, Reminder
- Includes security models: SecretTag, WrappedKey, VaultBlob, OpaqueSession
- Includes monitoring models: SystemHealth, Alert, AlertRule, etc.
- Fixed import path for JournalEntryTag model

✅ **Additional improvements:**
- Enhanced env.py with proper model imports
- Created migration documentation and best practices guide
- Verified existing migration chain integrity
- Confirmed autogeneration capability for future schema changes

## Files Modified

- backend/migrations/env.py (enhanced with all model imports)
- backend/docs/alembic_guide.md (new comprehensive documentation)
- Existing files verified:
  - alembic.ini (configuration file)
  - backend/migrations/ (migration directory structure)
  - requirements.txt (alembic dependency already present)
