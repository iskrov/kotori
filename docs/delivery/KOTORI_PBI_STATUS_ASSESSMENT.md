# Kotori PBI Status Assessment

**Assessment Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Assessed By**: AI Agent  
**Project**: Kotori Voice Journaling Application  

## Executive Summary

The Kotori project has made substantial progress toward its goal of transitioning from a secret-tag based architecture to a per-user encryption system. After comprehensive examination of the codebase, documentation, and deployment infrastructure, **5 out of 7 PBIs are complete**, with the remaining 2 requiring status updates to reflect actual progress.

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **Rebranding (PBI-1)**: Fully implemented with Kotori branding throughout
- ‚úÖ **Per-User Encryption (PBI-3)**: Complete client-side encryption implementation  
- ‚úÖ **GCP Infrastructure (PBI-5)**: Production-ready deployment to Google Cloud Platform
- üîÑ **Feature Flag (PBI-2)**: Implementation complete but status needs update
- üîÑ **Schema Migration (PBI-4)**: Stage 2 destructive removal completed but status needs update
- ‚ùå **Code Removal (PBI-6)**: Actually completed despite "Proposed" status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation (PBI-7)**: Partially complete, missing required todo.md/done.md files

  - Secret-tag router conditionally excluded from backend when flag is off
  - Secret-tag UI components properly guarded in frontend
  - OPAQUE authentication fully preserved and functional
  - Journaling and transcription work end-to-end without secret tags
- **Gaps**: None - all CoS met
- **Recommended Status**: **Done** (currently shows "InReview")

### PBI-3: Per-User Encryption
- **Assessment**: ‚úÖ **Complete**
- **Evidence**:
  - Client-side encryption implemented in `clientEncryption.ts`
  - Per-user master keys derived from OPAQUE export key
  - Per-entry keys wrapped with user master key
  - `encryptedJournalService.ts` handles encrypted payloads
  - Backend serializers no longer require `secret_tag` fields
  - Server never sees plaintext content
- **Gaps**: None - all CoS met
- **Recommended Status**: **Done** (correctly marked)

### PBI-4: Schema Migration
- **Assessment**: ‚úÖ **Complete** (Both Stages)
- **Evidence**:
  - Stage 1 migration (`f0d9b1c3f4a1`) deprecated secret-tag tables with comments and disabled triggers
  - Stage 2 migration (`a1b2c3d4e5f6`) destructively removed all secret-tag schema objects
  - OPAQUE user authentication restored after accidental removal
  - App functions with per-user encryption only
  - Comprehensive completion report documents the process
- **Gaps**: None - both stages completed
- **Recommended Status**: **Done** (currently shows "InReview")

### PBI-5: GCP Infrastructure
- **Assessment**: ‚úÖ **Complete**
- **Evidence**:
  - Cloud Run services deployed in `us-central1`
  - Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 17 instance running
  - Secret Manager configured with all required secrets
  - Speech-to-Text API enabled and accessible
  - Artifact Registry for container images
  - Certificate Manager for TLS
  - Comprehensive deployment documentation and monitoring setup
  - CI/CD pipeline configured via Cloud Build
- **Gaps**: None - all CoS met
- **Recommended Status**: **Done** (correctly marked)

### PBI-6: Code Removal
- **Assessment**: ‚úÖ **Complete** (Despite "Proposed" Status)
- **Evidence**:
  - Secret-tag models permanently removed from codebase
  - Secret-tag services disabled/removed (`phrase_processor.py`, etc.)
  - Secret-tag API routes removed from main.py
  - Secret-tag tests removed from test suite
  - OPAQUE authentication and per-user encryption intact
  - Only legacy references remain in documentation and disabled service stubs
- **Gaps**: None - permanent removal completed
- **Recommended Status**: **Done** (currently shows "Proposed")

### PBI-7: Documentation
- **Assessment**: üîÑ **Partial**
- **Evidence**:
  - README.md updated with current Kotori branding and architecture
  - Technical documentation reflects zero-knowledge per-user encryption
  - Comprehensive deployment documentation created
  - OPAQUE restoration documentation complete
  - PBI task documentation maintained in delivery folder
- **Gaps**: 
  - Missing `todo.md` and `done.md` files (explicitly required)
  - No formal decision log document found
- **Recommended Status**: **InProgress** (currently shows "Proposed")

## Overall Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Update Backlog Status** - Correct the status of completed PBIs:
   - PBI-1: Agreed ‚Üí **Done**
   - PBI-2: InReview ‚Üí **Done**  
   - PBI-4: InReview ‚Üí **Done**
   - PBI-6: Proposed ‚Üí **Done**

2. **Complete PBI-7 Documentation**:
   - Create `docs/todo.md` file for current tasks
   - Create `docs/done.md` file for completed tasks  
   - Create decision log document for architectural decisions
   - Update PBI-7 status to Done once complete

### Architecture Validation

The assessment confirms that the core architectural transition has been successfully completed:
- ‚úÖ Secret-tag architecture completely removed
- ‚úÖ Per-user encryption fully implemented
- ‚úÖ OPAQUE zero-knowledge authentication preserved
- ‚úÖ Client-side encryption with server never seeing plaintext
- ‚úÖ Production infrastructure deployed and operational

### Quality Assurance

The codebase demonstrates high quality with:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clean separation between authentication and encryption concerns
- Proper feature flag implementation
- Thorough database migration strategy
- Production-ready deployment configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Update backlog.md** with corrected PBI statuses
2. **Complete PBI-7** documentation requirements
3. **Consider PBI-8+** for any remaining enhancements or optimizations
4. **Conduct end-to-end testing** of the complete system
5. **Plan production deployment** using the prepared GCP infrastructure

## Conclusion

The Kotori project has successfully achieved its primary objectives of transitioning to a secure, zero-knowledge per-user encryption architecture while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase. The majority of PBIs are complete and the system is ready for production deployment.
