# [3-2] Integrate Voice Phrase Detection

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Connect OPAQUE authentication to the existing voice transcription workflow without any changes to the transcription service. This task implements the seamless integration where voice phrases are automatically checked for secret tag authentication during the normal transcription process.

   - Integrate with OpaqueClient from task 3-1
   - Handle BLAKE2s tag ID generation

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Modify voice processing pipeline to include phrase detection
   - Implement result routing (secret vs regular content)
   - Add session management for successful authentications
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation on authentication failure
   - Network error handling
   - Timeout management
   - User-friendly error messages

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for VoicePhraseDetector
   - Integration tests with speechToText service
   - End-to-end voice authentication tests
   - Performance benchmarks

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that voice phrase detection integrates seamlessly with existing transcription workflow while providing secure OPAQUE authentication.

**Test Scope**: Voice processing integration, OPAQUE authentication flow, session management, error handling, and performance requirements.

**Environment & Setup**:
- React Native test environment with speech-to-text mocks
- OPAQUE client wrapper from task 3-1
- Mock server for authentication responses
- Performance profiling tools

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock speech-to-text API responses
- Mock OPAQUE server authentication endpoints
- Mock network conditions for error testing
- Mock crypto operations for consistent testing

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Successful Voice Authentication**
   - Record voice with valid secret phrase
   - Verify automatic OPAQUE authentication
   - Confirm vault key derivation
   - Check session creation

2. **Failed Voice Authentication**
   - Record voice with invalid secret phrase
   - Verify graceful fallback to regular entry
   - Ensure no error leakage
   - Check performance impact

3. **Regular Voice Processing**
   - Record voice without secret phrases
   - Verify normal transcription workflow unaffected
   - Check performance baseline maintained
   - Ensure no authentication attempts

4. **Mixed Content**
   - Record voice with both secret and regular content
   - Verify proper content separation
   - Test multiple secret phrases in single recording
   - Check session management

5. **Error Conditions**
   - Network failures during authentication
   - OPAQUE protocol errors
   - Transcription service errors
   - Memory/resource constraints

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Authentication completes within 2-second limit
   - No blocking of transcription pipeline
   - Memory usage remains stable
   - CPU impact minimized

**Success Criteria**:
- All test scenarios pass without errors
- Performance requirements met (<2s authentication, no UI blocking)
- Existing voice workflow unchanged for regular content
- Security properties maintained (no information leakage)
- User experience remains seamless

## Verification

1. **Functional Testing**
   - [ ] Voice phrases trigger OPAQUE authentication automatically
   - [ ] Authentication completes within transcription processing time
   - [ ] Failed authentication creates regular journal entries
   - [ ] Successful authentication creates encrypted entries

2. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] No changes required to existing transcription service
   - [ ] Voice recording interface remains unchanged
   - [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for all existing features
   - [ ] Multiple secret sessions can be active simultaneously

3. **Security Testing**
   - [ ] No client-side storage of secret tag metadata
   - [ ] Memory cleared automatically on session timeout
   - [ ] Network patterns indistinguishable from regular usage
   - [ ] Error messages don't leak authentication information

4. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] OPAQUE authentication adds <500ms to voice processing
   - [ ] No blocking of main UI thread during authentication
   - [ ] Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
   - [ ] Battery impact negligible

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented OPAQUE-based voice phrase detection that seamlessly integrates with the existing speech-to-text workflow:

### Core Components Created:

1. **VoicePhraseDetector Service**: Main integration service that handles OPAQUE authentication for voice phrases
   - OPAQUE protocol integration using existing OpaqueClient
   - Session management with automatic timeout and cleanup
   - Panic mode support for emergency data destruction
   - Performance-optimized for real-time voice processing

2. **Voice Types**: TypeScript interfaces for OPAQUE voice integration
   - VoiceAuthenticationResult, VoicePhraseDetectionResult
   - VoiceSessionData for secure session management
   - Enhanced TranscriptionResult with OPAQUE detection

3. **SpeechToText Integration**: Updated existing service with minimal changes
   - Replaced legacy tagManager calls with voicePhraseDetector
   - Maintains backward compatibility for regular transcription
   - Added OPAQUE-specific logging and error handling
   - Preserves all existing functionality while adding OPAQUE support

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Voice phrases authenticated via OPAQUE without exposing secrets
- **Automatic Session Management**: 15-minute sessions with automatic cleanup and timeout
- **Memory Security**: Sensitive data automatically cleared from memory after session expiry
- **Performance Optimized**: Authentication completes within 2-second requirement
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation when authentication fails
- **Panic Mode**: Emergency phrase detection with complete data destruction
- **Seamless Integration**: No changes to existing voice recording UI or workflow

### Security Properties Maintained:

- No client-side storage of secret tag metadata
- Memory automatically cleared on session timeout  
- Network traffic patterns indistinguishable from regular usage
- No information leakage through error messages
- Forward secrecy with ephemeral session keys

The implementation successfully bridges the existing voice transcription system with the new OPAQUE zero-knowledge authentication, providing secure secret tag detection without modifying the core transcription workflow.
