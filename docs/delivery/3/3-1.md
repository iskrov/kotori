# [3-1] Create OPAQUE Client Wrapper

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement a TypeScript wrapper for the OPAQUE library that provides a clean, secure interface for the frontend application. This wrapper will encapsulate the OPAQUE cryptographic operations (registration, authentication, key derivation) with proper error handling and memory management.

## Requirements

1. **OPAQUE Library Integration**
   - Import and configure the OPAQUE library for React Native environment
   - Handle platform-specific implementations (iOS/Android/Web)
   - Ensure proper WebAssembly/native module integration

2. **Client Wrapper Interface**
   - Registration flow: `startRegistration()`, `finishRegistration()`
   - Authentication flow: `startAuthentication()`, `finishAuthentication()`
   - Key derivation: `deriveKeys()` for vault data encryption
   - Session management: `createSession()`, `destroySession()`

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of OPAQUE protocol errors
   - Network timeout and connectivity error handling
   - Memory allocation and cleanup error handling
   - No information leakage through error messages

4. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic clearing of sensitive data from memory
   - Secure cleanup on session timeout
   - Protection against memory dumps and forensic analysis

5. **Security Properties**
   - Zero-knowledge authentication without revealing secrets to server
   - Perfect forward secrecy for session keys
   - Resistance to offline dictionary attacks
   - Constant-time operations where possible

## Implementation Plan

1. **Library Setup**
   - Research and select appropriate OPAQUE library for React Native
   - Configure build system for WebAssembly/native modules
   - Set up TypeScript type definitions

2. **Core Wrapper Implementation**
   - Create `OpaqueClient` class with clean API
   - Implement registration and authentication flows
   - Add key derivation functionality
   - Implement session management

3. **Error Handling System**
   - Define error types and handling strategies
   - Implement graceful degradation patterns
   - Add logging for debugging without information leakage

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement memory clearing mechanisms
   - Add constant-time comparison functions
   - Implement secure random number generation

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests with mock server
   - Security tests for memory management
   - Performance benchmarks

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that the OPAQUE client wrapper provides secure, reliable authentication functionality with proper error handling and memory management.

**Test Scope**: OPAQUE client wrapper class, registration/authentication flows, key derivation, memory management, and error handling.

**Environment & Setup**:
- React Native test environment
- Mock OPAQUE server for testing
- Memory profiling tools for security testing

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock network requests to OPAQUE server
- Mock platform-specific modules for cross-platform testing
- Mock secure storage for session testing

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Registration Flow**
   - Successful registration with valid credentials
   - Registration failure with invalid server response
   - Network timeout during registration
   - Memory cleanup after registration

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Successful authentication with correct credentials
   - Authentication failure with incorrect credentials
   - Network timeout during authentication
   - Memory cleanup after authentication

3. **Key Derivation**
   - Successful key derivation from authenticated session
   - Key derivation with multiple vault IDs
   - Memory cleanup after key derivation

4. **Session Management**
   - Session creation and destruction
   - Session timeout handling
   - Multiple concurrent sessions
   - Memory cleanup on session destruction

5. **Error Handling**
   - Network connectivity errors
   - OPAQUE protocol errors
   - Memory allocation errors
   - Information leakage prevention

6. **Memory Management**
   - Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
   - No memory leaks during normal operation
   - Secure cleanup on app backgrounding
   - Protection against memory dumps

**Success Criteria**:
- All test scenarios pass without errors
- Memory profiling shows no sensitive data leakage
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<500ms for authentication)
- Error handling provides user-friendly messages without information leakage

## Verification

1. **Functional Testing**
   - [ ] Registration flow completes successfully
   - [ ] Authentication flow works with correct credentials
   - [ ] Key derivation produces correct encryption keys
   - [ ] Session management handles timeouts correctly

2. **Security Testing**
   - [ ] Memory is cleared after operations
   - [ ] No sensitive data visible in memory dumps
   - [ ] Error messages don't leak information
   - [ ] Constant-time operations prevent timing attacks

3. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Authentication completes within 500ms
   - [ ] Memory usage remains stable during operations
   - [ ] No memory leaks during extended testing
   - [ ] CPU usage remains acceptable

4. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Works correctly with React Native platform
   - [ ] Integrates with existing voice processing workflow
   - [ ] Handles network connectivity issues gracefully
   - [ ] Maintains compatibility across iOS/Android/Web
