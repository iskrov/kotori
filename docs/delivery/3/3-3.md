# [3-3] Implement Session Management

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create enhanced session management capabilities for OPAQUE secret tag sessions, building upon the basic session handling already implemented in VoicePhraseDetector. This task focuses on advanced session features like persistence, cross-app session synchronization, and user-controlled session management.

## Requirements

### Basic Session Management (Already Implemented in Task 3-2)
✅ Session creation with OPAQUE authentication  
✅ Automatic 15-minute timeout with cleanup  
✅ Memory management for sensitive data  
✅ Multiple concurrent sessions support  
✅ Session expiry checking  

### Enhanced Session Management (This Task)

1. **Session Persistence and Recovery**
   - Persist active session metadata (not keys) across app restarts
   - Recover sessions with re-authentication after app restart
   - Handle app backgrounding/foregrounding session lifecycle
   - Graceful session restoration with security checks

2. **Advanced Session Controls**
   - Manual session extension (add time to existing sessions)
   - Session lock/unlock functionality for temporary deactivation
   - Batch session management (activate/deactivate multiple tags)
   - Session priority handling for conflicting operations

3. **Cross-Platform Session Synchronization**
   - Detect same-user sessions on other devices (if applicable)
   - Handle session conflicts when multiple devices authenticate same tag
   - Session invalidation notifications from server
   - Graceful session migration between devices

4. **Session Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Session usage statistics and patterns
   - Security audit trail for session events
   - Session performance metrics
   - Detection of unusual session patterns

5. **Enhanced Security Features**
   - Session fingerprinting for device binding
   - Detection of concurrent session abuse
   - Automatic session invalidation on security events
   - Session key rotation capabilities

## Implementation Plan

1. **Session Persistence Layer**
   - Create SessionStorageManager for non-sensitive session metadata
   - Implement secure session recovery flow with re-authentication
   - Add app lifecycle event handlers for session management
   - Create session restoration UI flow

2. **Advanced Session Controls Service**
   - Extend VoicePhraseDetector with manual session controls
   - Implement SessionControlManager for advanced operations
   - Add session locking/unlocking mechanisms
   - Create batch session operation APIs

3. **Cross-Platform Integration**
   - Design session synchronization protocol
   - Implement conflict resolution for multi-device sessions
   - Add session invalidation handling from server
   - Create session migration APIs

4. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Create SessionAnalytics service for tracking
   - Implement security audit logging
   - Add performance monitoring for session operations
   - Create session health monitoring

5. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement device fingerprinting for sessions
   - Add session abuse detection algorithms
   - Create automatic security event handlers
   - Implement session key rotation system

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that enhanced session management provides secure, reliable, and user-friendly control over OPAQUE secret tag sessions while maintaining all security properties.

**Test Scope**: Session persistence, advanced controls, cross-platform sync, analytics, and enhanced security features.

**Environment & Setup**:
- React Native test environment with session management services
- Mock server for cross-platform session testing
- App lifecycle simulation for persistence testing
- Multi-device testing environment for synchronization

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock AsyncStorage for session persistence testing
- Mock app lifecycle events (background/foreground)
- Mock server endpoints for session synchronization
- Mock device fingerprinting APIs

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Session Persistence**
   - App restart with active sessions
   - Session recovery with re-authentication
   - Background/foreground session handling
   - Failed session recovery scenarios

2. **Advanced Session Controls**
   - Manual session extension
   - Session lock/unlock operations
   - Batch session management
   - Session priority conflict resolution

3. **Cross-Platform Synchronization**
   - Multi-device session detection
   - Session conflict resolution
   - Server-initiated session invalidation
   - Session migration between devices

4. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Session usage tracking accuracy
   - Security audit trail completeness
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Unusual pattern detection

5. **Enhanced Security**
   - Device fingerprinting validation
   - Concurrent session abuse detection
   - Security event response
   - Session key rotation

6. **Integration Testing**
   - Integration with existing VoicePhraseDetector
   - Compatibility with voice authentication flow
   - Performance impact on voice processing
   - User experience consistency

**Success Criteria**:
- All test scenarios pass without security violations
- Session persistence works reliably across app restarts
- Advanced controls provide expected functionality
- Cross-platform sync resolves conflicts correctly
- Analytics provide accurate session insights
- Enhanced security features detect and prevent abuse
- Integration maintains voice authentication performance

## Verification

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - [x] Session metadata persists across app restarts
   - [x] Session recovery requires proper re-authentication
   - [x] Manual session extension works correctly
   - [x] Session lock/unlock functions properly
   - [ ] Batch session operations work as expected (simplified implementation)
   - [ ] Cross-platform session detection functions (future enhancement)
   - [ ] Session conflict resolution works correctly (future enhancement)

2. **Security Testing**
