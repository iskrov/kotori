# [3-8] Create Manual Session Controls

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build UI components for manual session extension, deactivation, and management of OPAQUE-authenticated secret tag sessions. This provides users with direct control over their active sessions beyond the automatic timeout management, including the ability to extend sessions, manually deactivate them, and view session status.
