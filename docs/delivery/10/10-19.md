# [10-19] Style consistency and animations

## Description
Ensure all sharing components follow the existing app design system and add smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience. This includes standardizing colors, typography, spacing, component styling, and implementing meaningful animations that guide users through the sharing workflow.

## Animation Implementation Details

### 1. Screen Transitions
```typescript
// Slide transition for navigation
const slideTransition = {
  gestureEnabled: true,
  cardStyleInterpolator: CardStyleInterpolators.forHorizontalIOS,
  transitionSpec: {
    open: TransitionSpecs.TransitionIOSSpec,
    close: TransitionSpecs.TransitionIOSSpec,
  },
};

// Modal presentation
const modalTransition = {
  cardStyleInterpolator: CardStyleInterpolators.forModalPresentationIOS,
  gestureEnabled: true,
  gestureDirection: 'vertical',
};
```

### 2. Button Press Animations
```typescript
const useButtonAnimation = () => {
  const scaleValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;
  
  const pressIn = () => {
    Animated.spring(scaleValue, {
      toValue: 0.95,
      useNativeDriver: true,
      tension: 300,
      friction: 10,
    }).start();
  };
  
  const pressOut = () => {
    Animated.spring(scaleValue, {
      toValue: 1,
      useNativeDriver: true,
      tension: 300,
      friction: 10,
    }).start();
  };
  
  return { scaleValue, pressIn, pressOut };
};
```

### 3. Loading State Animations
```typescript
const usePulseAnimation = () => {
  const pulseValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const pulse = Animated.loop(
      Animated.sequence([
        Animated.timing(pulseValue, {
          toValue: 1.1,
          duration: 1000,
          easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease),
          useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
        Animated.timing(pulseValue, {
          toValue: 1,
          duration: 1000,
          easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease),
          useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
      ])
    );
    pulse.start();
    return () => pulse.stop();
  }, []);
  
  return pulseValue;
};
```

### 4. Success/Error Feedback
```typescript
const useStatusAnimation = () => {
  const fadeValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
  const scaleValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(0.8)).current;
  
  const showSuccess = () => {
    Animated.parallel([
      Animated.timing(fadeValue, {
        toValue: 1,
        duration: 300,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }),
      Animated.spring(scaleValue, {
        toValue: 1,
        tension: 100,
        friction: 8,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }),
    ]).start();
  };
  
  return { fadeValue, scaleValue, showSuccess };
};
```

## Animation Performance Considerations

### Native Driver Usage
- Use `useNativeDriver: true` for transform and opacity animations
- Avoid using native driver for layout properties (width, height, padding)
- Batch animations using `Animated.parallel()` for better performance

### Memory Management
- Properly cleanup animations in component unmount
- Use `Animated.loop()` sparingly and always provide cleanup
- Avoid creating new Animated.Value instances on re-renders

### Device Performance
- Test animations on lower-end devices
- Provide fallback for reduced motion preferences
- Use `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions()` for heavy animations

### Accessibility Considerations
- Respect `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()`
- Provide alternative feedback for users with motion sensitivity
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers

## Test Plan

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot testing for all sharing screens
- Theme switching tests (light/dark mode)
- Different screen sizes and orientations
- Animation state capture at key frames

### Performance Testing
- 60fps animation performance on target devices
- Memory usage during animations
- Battery impact of animations
- Smooth scrolling with animated list items

### Accessibility Testing
