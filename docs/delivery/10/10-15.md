# [10-15] Implement share options modal

## Description
Implement the full functionality for the share options modal that was created as a placeholder in Task 10-14. This includes PDF download, native share sheet integration, and email sharing capabilities. The modal should provide a seamless sharing experience with proper platform-specific integrations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Replace placeholder ShareOptions modal with full functionality
- Implement PDF download using backend API
- Integrate with React Native's native share sheet
- Add email sharing capability with pre-filled content
- Handle sharing errors gracefully with user feedback
- Support sharing via different platforms (messaging, social media, etc.)

- Provide clear feedback for successful/failed shares
- Support cancellation of sharing operations
- Display appropriate icons and descriptions for each option
- Handle permissions for file access and email
- Graceful fallbacks when sharing options unavailable

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Backend API Integration
- Create shareService to interact with backend APIs
- Implement PDF download functionality
- Add proper error handling for API calls
- Handle authentication and authorization

### Step 2: Native Share Integration
- Install and configure react-native-share package
- Implement share sheet with PDF and text content
- Handle platform-specific sharing options
- Add fallbacks for unsupported platforms

### Step 3: Email Integration
- Configure Expo MailComposer
- Pre-fill email with share content and PDF attachment
- Handle email client availability
- Provide fallback options when no email client available

### Step 4: File Management
- Implement local file storage for downloaded PDFs
- Handle file cleanup after sharing
- Manage temporary files and cache
- Support file permissions and access

### Step 5: Error Handling & UX
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement loading states and progress indicators
- Provide user feedback for all operations
- Handle edge cases and network failures

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- ShareOptions component functionality
- PDF download service
- Email composition service
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Backend API integration
- File download and storage
- Native share sheet integration
- Email client integration

### Platform Tests
- iOS share sheet behavior
- Android share sheet behavior
- Web fallback behavior (if applicable)
- Different email clients

### Edge Case Tests
- Network failure during PDF generation
- Insufficient storage space
- Missing email client
- Sharing cancellation
- Large PDF files
- Concurrent sharing operations

## Files to Modify

### New Files
- `frontend/src/services/shareService.ts` - Backend API integration
- `frontend/src/services/fileService.ts` - File download and management
- `frontend/src/hooks/useNativeShare.ts` - Native sharing hook
- `frontend/src/hooks/useEmailShare.ts` - Email sharing hook

### Modified Files
- `frontend/src/screens/SharePreviewScreen/components/ShareOptions.tsx` - Full implementation
- `frontend/package.json` - Add react-native-share dependency
- `frontend/src/screens/SharePreviewScreen/components/__tests__/ShareOptions.test.tsx` - New tests

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
- `react-native-share` - Native share sheet integration
- `expo-mail-composer` - Email composition
- `expo-file-system` - File download and management
- `expo-sharing` - Additional sharing capabilities

### Backend Dependencies
- PDF generation endpoint (`GET /api/v1/shares/{id}/pdf`)
- Share token validation
- Proper CORS configuration for file downloads

## Success Criteria
- [x] PDF downloads work on all platforms (implemented with FileSystem.downloadAsync)
- [x] Native share sheet opens with PDF and text (implemented with expo-sharing)
- [x] Email composition pre-fills correctly (implemented with expo-mail-composer)
- [x] Loading states show during operations (ActivityIndicator and loading text)
- [x] Error messages are clear and actionable (comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages)
- [x] File cleanup happens automatically (cleanup after 5 seconds)
- [x] Sharing cancellation works properly (handles user cancellation gracefully)
- [x] All platforms supported (iOS, Android, Web with appropriate fallbacks)
- [x] Performance is acceptable for large PDFs (efficient file handling and cleanup)
- [x] UI matches app design system (consistent theming and styling)
- [x] Accessibility requirements met (proper accessibility attributes and disabled states)

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Implemented:
1. **PDF Download Service** - `shareService.ts` with full backend API integration
2. **Native Sharing Hook** - `useNativeShare.ts` with expo-sharing integration  
3. **Email Sharing Hook** - `useEmailShare.ts` with expo-mail-composer integration
4. **Enhanced ShareOptions Modal** - Full functionality replacing placeholders

### Key Components:
- **ShareService**: Backend API integration for PDF generation and download
- **useNativeShare**: Cross-platform native sharing with file and text support
- **useEmailShare**: Email composition with attachment support and availability checking
- **ShareOptions**: Complete modal with loading states, error handling, and platform-specific features

### Platform Support:
- **iOS**: Native share sheet, Mail app integration, proper UTI handling for PDFs
- **Android**: Native share sheet, Gmail/email client integration
- **Web**: Web Share API with clipboard fallback for unsupported browsers

### Error Handling:
- Network failures during PDF generation
- Missing email clients with platform-specific error messages
- Share cancellation handling
- File permission and storage errors
- Comprehensive user feedback for all error states

### Performance Optimizations:
- Automatic file cleanup after sharing
- Efficient PDF download with progress handling
- Proper loading states to prevent multiple concurrent operations
- Memory-efficient file handling

### Testing:
- Comprehensive unit tests for all hooks and components
- Mock implementations for all external dependencies
- Error scenario testing and edge case coverage
- Platform-specific behavior testing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Platform Differences**: Test on both iOS and Android extensively
- **File Permissions**: Handle permission requests gracefully
- **Network Issues**: Implement retry mechanisms and offline handling
