# [10-16] Add share history view

## Description
Implement a share history view that displays previously created shares, allowing users to track what they've shared, when, and with whom. This provides transparency and control over shared information, with options to view, re-share, or revoke existing shares.

## Status History

|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-01-27 23:30:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task created | ai-agent |
| 2025-01-27 23:35:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Started implementation | ai-agent |
| 2025-01-28 00:15:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Done | Implementation completed with full functionality and tests | ai-agent |

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Implemented:
1. **ShareHistoryScreen** - Complete history view with search, loading, error, and empty states
2. **useShareHistory Hook** - Data management with fetch, refresh, delete, and processing logic
3. **ShareHistoryList** - FlatList component with pull-to-refresh and proper item rendering
4. **ShareHistoryItem** - Individual share display with metadata, status indicators, and actions
5. **EmptyState** - User-friendly empty state with onboarding guidance

### Key Components:
- **ShareHistoryScreen**: Main container with navigation, search, and state management
- **useShareHistory**: Custom hook for share data management and API integration
- **ShareHistoryList**: Optimized list rendering with refresh control
- **ShareHistoryItem**: Rich item display with status indicators and action buttons
- **EmptyState**: Contextual empty state with search results and onboarding

### Share Status System:
- **Active**: Green checkmark, shows days until expiry
- **Expired**: Red clock icon, shows "Expired" status
- **Revoked**: Gray ban icon, shows "Revoked" status
- **Expiring Soon**: Warning states for shares expiring within 7 days

### User Experience Features:
- **Real-time Search**: Instant filtering by share title or template name
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Standard iOS/Android refresh pattern
- **Smart Empty States**: Different messages for no shares vs. no search results
- **Action Buttons**: Re-share (active shares only) and delete with confirmation
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded icons and text for share status
- **Metadata Display**: Creation date, access count, template name, expiration info

### Navigation Integration:
- **From ShareScreen**: "View History" button navigates to history
- **To SharePreview**: Tap share item or re-share button navigates to preview
- **Back Navigation**: Proper back button and navigation stack integration

### Error Handling:
- **Network Errors**: Comprehensive error display with retry functionality
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators during API calls
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when no shares exist
- **Search Results**: Appropriate messaging when search returns no results

### Performance Optimizations:
- **FlatList**: Efficient rendering for large lists of shares
- **Concurrent Protection**: Prevents multiple simultaneous fetch/refresh operations
- **Local State Updates**: Immediate UI updates for delete operations
- **Smart Re-renders**: Optimized component updates and memoization

### Testing:
- **ShareHistoryScreen Tests**: 8 comprehensive test cases covering all states and interactions
- **useShareHistory Tests**: 12 detailed test cases for hook functionality and edge cases
- **Component Integration**: Navigation, search, error handling, and data processing testing
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Expired shares, empty states, concurrent operations, error scenarios

## Design Considerations

### Share Status Indicators
- **Active**: Green indicator, shows remaining time
- **Expired**: Red indicator, option to extend or delete
- **Revoked**: Gray indicator, option to re-create
- **Accessed**: Blue indicator with access count

### Information Architecture
```
ShareHistoryScreen
├── Header (title, search icon)
├── ShareHistoryList
│   ├── ShareHistoryItem (for each share)
│   │   ├── Share title and template name
│   │   ├── Creation date and expiration
│   │   ├── Status indicator
│   │   ├── Access count (if available)
│   │   └── Action buttons (re-share, delete)
│   └── Empty state (when no shares)
└── Pull-to-refresh functionality
```

### Actions Available
- **View**: Navigate to share preview screen
- **Re-share**: Open share options modal
- **Extend**: Extend expiration date (future enhancement)
- **Revoke**: Delete share with confirmation
- **Copy Link**: Copy public share URL if available

## Risk Mitigation
- **Large Data Sets**: Implement pagination or virtual scrolling
- **Network Issues**: Cache data locally and show cached results
- **Concurrent Access**: Handle share updates from other devices
- **Performance**: Optimize list rendering for smooth scrolling
- **Data Consistency**: Refresh data when returning to screen
