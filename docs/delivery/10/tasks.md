## Implementation Order

The tasks should be implemented in the following sequence to minimize dependencies:

### Week 1 (Days 1-5)
1. **10-1**: Template models and API (Day 1)
2. **10-2**: Gemini integration (Days 1-2)
3. **10-3**: Share generation backend (Days 2-3)
4. **10-4**: PDF generation (Days 3-4)
5. **10-9**: Import template from file (PDF/DOCX) (Days 4-5)
6. **10-7**: Security features (Day 4-5, in parallel)

### Week 2 (Days 6-10)
6. **10-5**: Frontend UI (Days 6-8)
7. **10-6**: Email integration (Day 8)
8. **10-8**: Testing and deployment (Days 9-10)

## Task Dependencies

```
10-1 (Templates) → 10-2 (Gemini) → 10-3 (Share Gen)
                                   ↓              ↓
                         10-9 (Import)     10-7 (Security)
                                   ↓              ↓
                         10-5 (Frontend UI) → 10-8 (Testing)
                                   ↓
                          10-4 (PDF) → 10-6 (Email)
```

## Risk Management

- **Critical Path**: 10-1 → 10-2 → 10-3 → 10-5 → 10-8
- **Parallel Work**: 10-4 and 10-7 can be done in parallel with 10-2/10-3
- **Optional**: 10-6 (email) can be deferred if timeline is tight

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Feature flag enabled for gradual rollout
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured

## Notes

- Templates will be hardcoded initially (JSON files) with CRUD API for future expansion
- Gemini prompts should be versioned and tested thoroughly
- PDF generation should work across all platforms (fallback to server-side if needed)
- Email is optional but should be ready for quick activation
