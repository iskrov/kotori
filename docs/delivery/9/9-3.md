# [9-3] Validate schema against PostgreSQL best practices

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Comprehensive validation of the newly created UUID-standardized schema against PostgreSQL best practices. This task ensures the schema follows performance, security, and maintainability guidelines.

## Requirements

### Core Validation Areas

1. **Primary Key Standards**
   - All core tables use native UUID primary keys
   - SecretTag model properly structured with UUID primary key
   - OPAQUE sessions table uses string primary key (protocol requirement)

2. **Index Strategy Validation**
   - All foreign key columns have proper indexes
   - Unique constraints are properly indexed
   - Composite indexes for common query patterns
   - No redundant or unused indexes

3. **Constraint Validation**
   - Foreign key constraints properly defined
   - Unique constraints enforce business rules
   - Check constraints where appropriate
   - Proper nullable/not nullable settings

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query-specific indexes for common patterns
   - Proper data types for optimal storage
   - Efficient relationship modeling

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Sensitive data properly handled
   - Audit logging structure
   - Session management security

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Schema Structure Analysis
1. Extract complete schema information from database
2. Analyze table relationships and dependencies
3. Validate primary key consistency
4. Check foreign key relationships

### Phase 2: Index Performance Review
1. Analyze all indexes for effectiveness
2. Identify missing indexes for common queries
3. Check for redundant indexes
4. Validate unique constraint indexes

### Phase 3: Constraint Validation
1. Verify all foreign key constraints
2. Check unique constraint enforcement
3. Validate business logic constraints
4. Review nullable field settings

### Phase 4: PostgreSQL Best Practices Compliance
1. Data type optimization review
2. Naming convention compliance
3. Performance pattern validation
4. Security configuration review

### Phase 5: Documentation and Recommendations
1. Document findings and compliance status
2. Provide recommendations for improvements
3. Create performance baseline documentation
4. Update schema documentation

## Test Plan

### Schema Validation Tests
- **Objective**: Verify schema structure meets PostgreSQL best practices
- **Test Scope**: All 14 tables and their relationships
- **Environment**: Development database with applied migration
- **Key Scenarios**:
  1. Primary key consistency validation
  2. Foreign key relationship verification
  3. Index effectiveness analysis
  4. Constraint enforcement testing
  5. Performance pattern validation

### Success Criteria
- All tables follow UUID primary key standard (except protocol-required exceptions)
- All foreign keys have proper indexes
- No redundant or missing indexes
- All constraints properly enforce business rules
- Schema follows PostgreSQL naming conventions
- Performance meets or exceeds baseline requirements

## Verification

### Validation Checklist
- [x] All 14 tables created successfully
- [x] UUID primary keys on all core tables
- [x] SecretTag model properly structured
- [x] All foreign key indexes present
- [x] Unique constraints properly indexed
- [x] Query performance indexes optimal
- [x] Business logic constraints enforced
- [x] PostgreSQL best practices followed
- [x] Security considerations addressed
- [x] Documentation updated

### Performance Metrics
- Index usage analysis
- Query execution plan validation
- Storage optimization assessment
- Relationship traversal efficiency

## Files Modified

### Created Files
- `schema_validation.py` - Temporary validation script (will be deleted)
- `schema_validation_report.md` - Comprehensive validation report

### Analysis Results
- No critical issues found requiring migration file updates
- All PostgreSQL best practices followed
- Schema ready for application code implementation

## Dependencies

- Task 9-1: Schema migration must be completed
- Task 9-2: Indexes and constraints must be implemented
- Database must be accessible for analysis

## Notes

- This validation ensures the schema foundation is solid before proceeding with application code updates
- Any critical issues found should be addressed before moving to task 9-4
- Performance baselines established here will be used for future optimization
- Schema documentation will be updated based on findings
