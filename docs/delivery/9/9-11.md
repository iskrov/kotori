## Requirements

### Core Performance Testing Requirements
- Test query performance for UUID-based primary key lookups
- Validate performance of foreign key queries with UUID values
- Test index effectiveness for common query patterns
- Benchmark query execution times against performance baselines
- Test performance under concurrent access scenarios

### Specific Performance Tests
1. **Primary Key Lookups**: Test single record retrieval by UUID
2. **Foreign Key Queries**: Test relationship queries with UUID foreign keys
3. **Index Utilization**: Verify that queries are using indexes effectively
4. **Bulk Operations**: Test performance of bulk inserts, updates, and queries
5. **Concurrent Access**: Test performance under concurrent read/write scenarios
6. **Range Queries**: Test performance of queries with UUID ranges or filtering

### Performance Benchmarks
- Single record lookups: < 5ms average response time
- Bulk operations (100 records): < 50ms average response time
- Concurrent access (10 simultaneous queries): < 100ms average response time
- Index scan queries: < 20ms average response time
- Complex relationship queries: < 50ms average response time

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Performance Test Framework Setup
1. Create performance testing infrastructure
2. Set up database with representative test data
3. Create test data generators for UUID-based records
4. Implement timing and measurement utilities

### Phase 2: Core Performance Tests
1. Implement primary key lookup performance tests
2. Create foreign key relationship performance tests
3. Test index utilization and query plan analysis
4. Implement bulk operation performance tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Performance Scenarios
1. Create concurrent access performance tests
2. Test complex query performance (joins, aggregations)
3. Implement stress testing for high-load scenarios
4. Create performance regression tests

### Phase 4: Performance Analysis and Optimization
1. Analyze query execution plans
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Validate index effectiveness
4. Document performance characteristics

## Test Plan

### Objective
Validate that UUID-based database queries meet performance requirements and that indexes are effectively utilized.

### Test Environment
- PostgreSQL database with UUID schema
- Representative test data (1000+ records per table)
- Isolated test environment to ensure consistent measurements
- Query plan analysis enabled

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Primary Key Performance Tests
- **Test**: Single record retrieval by UUID
- **Expected**: < 5ms average response time
- **Verification**: Direct SELECT queries with UUID primary keys

#### 2. Foreign Key Relationship Tests
- **Test**: Journal entries by user UUID, tags by journal UUID
- **Expected**: < 20ms average response time
- **Verification**: JOIN queries using UUID foreign keys

#### 3. Index Utilization Tests
- **Test**: Query execution plan analysis
- **Expected**: All queries use appropriate indexes
- **Verification**: EXPLAIN ANALYZE for all tested queries

#### 4. Bulk Operation Tests
- **Test**: Bulk inserts, updates, and queries
- **Expected**: < 50ms for 100 record operations
- **Verification**: Batch operations with timing measurements

#### 5. Concurrent Access Tests
- **Test**: Multiple simultaneous queries
- **Expected**: < 100ms average with 10 concurrent operations
- **Verification**: Multi-threaded query execution

#### 6. Complex Query Tests
- **Test**: Multi-table joins and aggregations
- **Expected**: < 50ms for typical business queries
- **Verification**: Realistic application query patterns

### Success Criteria
