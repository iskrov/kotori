## Requirements

1. **Deployment Procedures Documentation**:
   - Pre-deployment checklist and validation steps
   - Step-by-step deployment process for UUID schema changes
   - Database migration execution procedures
   - Application deployment coordination
   - Post-deployment validation and testing
   - Monitoring and alerting setup

2. **Rollback Plan Documentation**:
   - Rollback triggers and decision criteria
   - Step-by-step rollback procedures
   - Data recovery and restoration processes
   - Application rollback coordination

   - Include data recovery processes
   - Document rollback validation steps

3. **Document operational considerations**:
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Resource requirements
   - Communication procedures
   - Environment-specific guidance

## Test Plan

### Objective
Validate that the deployment and rollback documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and actionable.

### Test Scope
- Documentation completeness and accuracy
- Procedure clarity and step-by-step guidance
- Risk assessment coverage

- Documentation includes proper risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Operational considerations are thoroughly documented
- Documentation is reviewed and validated for accuracy

## Verification

- [x] Deployment procedures documentation created
- [x] Rollback plan documentation created
- [x] Operational considerations documented
- [x] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies included
- [x] Documentation reviewed for completeness and accuracy
- [x] All files properly organized in technical documentation structure
