## Requirements

### Core Testing Requirements
- Test UUID primary key generation and validation
- Test foreign key relationships with UUID values
- Test model CRUD operations with UUID parameters
- Test business logic constraints and validation
- Test model serialization/deserialization with UUIDs

### Specific Model Tests
1. **User Model**: Verify existing UUID implementation
2. **Journal Entry Model**: Test UUID primary key and relationships
3. **Tag Model**: Test UUID primary key and user relationships
4. **Reminder Model**: Test UUID primary key and user relationships
5. **SecretTag Model**: Test UUID primary key and phrase_hash separation

### Test Coverage Areas
- Model instantiation with UUID values
- Primary key generation and uniqueness
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Relationship traversal and eager loading
- Model validation and error handling
- Database constraint enforcement

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup

   - Test model relationships

4. **Reminder Model Tests**
   - Test UUID primary key generation
   - Test user_id foreign key relationship

   - Test CRUD operations through relationships

4. **User-SecretTag Relationships**
   - Test one-to-many relationship
   - Test phrase_hash lookups
   - Test OPAQUE integration points

### Phase 4: Constraint and Validation Tests
1. **Primary Key Constraints**
   - Test UUID uniqueness
   - Test primary key generation
   - Test constraint violations

2. **Foreign Key Constraints**
   - Test referential integrity
   - Test cascade behaviors
   - Test constraint violation handling

3. **Business Logic Constraints**
   - Test unique constraints
   - Test NOT NULL constraints
   - Test CHECK constraints (if any)

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that all model changes work correctly with UUID primary keys and maintain proper relationships, constraints, and business logic.

### Test Environment
- Local development environment
- Test database with UUID schema
- pytest testing framework
- SQLAlchemy testing utilities

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Model Creation Tests**
   - Create models with UUID primary keys
   - Verify UUID generation is automatic
   - Test model validation passes

2. **CRUD Operation Tests**
   - Create: Insert models with UUID values
   - Read: Query models by UUID primary keys
   - Update: Modify models using UUID identifiers
   - Delete: Remove models using UUID identifiers

3. **Relationship Tests**
   - Create related models with UUID foreign keys
   - Query relationships using UUID values
   - Test eager loading with UUID relationships
   - Verify cascade operations work correctly

4. **Constraint Tests**
   - Test primary key uniqueness
   - Test foreign key referential integrity
   - Test unique constraint enforcement
   - Test NOT NULL constraint validation

5. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test invalid UUID format handling
   - Test constraint violation responses
   - Test orphaned record prevention
   - Test transaction rollback scenarios

### Success Criteria
- All model tests pass with UUID values
- CRUD operations work correctly with UUID parameters
- Relationships function properly with UUID foreign keys
- Constraints are properly enforced
- Error handling works as expected
- Test coverage meets minimum requirements (>90%)
