# [9-12] Schema validation and constraint testing

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing for database schema validation and constraint enforcement with UUID-based primary keys. This task validates that all database constraints, foreign key relationships, and business logic enforcement work correctly with the new UUID schema, ensuring data integrity and proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Core Schema Validation Requirements
- Test all database constraints with UUID primary keys
- Validate foreign key constraint enforcement
- Test unique constraint validation
- Verify NOT NULL constraint enforcement
- Test check constraint validation
- Validate cascade delete behavior
- Test data type validation for UUID fields

### Specific Constraint Tests
1. **Primary Key Constraints**: Verify UUID primary key uniqueness and format
2. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Test referential integrity with UUID foreign keys
3. **Unique Constraints**: Validate unique constraint enforcement (e.g., email uniqueness)
4. **NOT NULL Constraints**: Test required field validation
5. **Check Constraints**: Validate business logic constraints
6. **Cascade Operations**: Test ON DELETE CASCADE behavior
7. **Index Constraints**: Verify index uniqueness and performance

### Business Logic Validation
- Test user email uniqueness enforcement
- Validate journal entry ownership constraints
- Test tag-journal relationship constraints
- Verify reminder-user relationship constraints
- Test secret tag access constraints
- Validate timestamp constraints (created_at, updated_at)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Schema Constraint Testing Framework
1. Create schema validation test utilities
2. Set up constraint violation test helpers
3. Implement database state verification utilities
4. Create test data generators for constraint testing

### Phase 2: Primary and Foreign Key Constraint Tests
1. Test UUID primary key uniqueness enforcement
2. Validate foreign key constraint enforcement
3. Test cascading delete operations
4. Verify referential integrity maintenance

### Phase 3: Business Logic Constraint Tests
1. Test unique constraint enforcement (email, etc.)
2. Validate NOT NULL constraint enforcement
3. Test check constraint validation
4. Verify custom business logic constraints

### Phase 4: Advanced Constraint Scenarios
1. Test constraint behavior under concurrent operations
2. Validate constraint error handling and messages
3. Test constraint performance impact
4. Verify constraint behavior in edge cases

## Test Plan

### Objective
Validate that all database constraints work correctly with UUID primary keys and that business logic constraints are properly enforced.

### Test Environment
- PostgreSQL database with UUID schema
- Test data that exercises all constraint types
- Isolated test environment for constraint violation testing
- Transaction rollback capabilities for clean testing

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Primary Key Constraint Tests
- **Test**: Attempt to insert duplicate UUID primary keys
- **Expected**: Constraint violation error
- **Verification**: Primary key uniqueness is enforced

#### 2. Foreign Key Constraint Tests
- **Test**: Insert records with invalid foreign key UUIDs
- **Expected**: Foreign key constraint violation
- **Verification**: Referential integrity is maintained

#### 3. Unique Constraint Tests
- **Test**: Insert duplicate email addresses
- **Expected**: Unique constraint violation
- **Verification**: Email uniqueness is enforced

#### 4. NOT NULL Constraint Tests
- **Test**: Insert records with NULL required fields
- **Expected**: NOT NULL constraint violation
- **Verification**: Required fields are enforced

#### 5. Cascade Delete Tests
- **Test**: Delete parent records with child dependencies
- **Expected**: Cascading deletion of child records
- **Verification**: CASCADE behavior works correctly

#### 6. Check Constraint Tests
- **Test**: Insert data violating check constraints
- **Expected**: Check constraint violation
- **Verification**: Business logic constraints are enforced

### Success Criteria
- All constraint types properly enforce data integrity
- Appropriate error messages are returned for violations
