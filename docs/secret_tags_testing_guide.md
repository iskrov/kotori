#### 5-Step Clearing Process
When switching to online mode, the system executes a comprehensive clearing process.

**Step 1: Secret Tag Deactivation**
```typescript
// Test: Verify all active tags are deactivated
const activeTags = await tagManager.getActiveSecretTags();
await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
const afterActiveTags = await tagManager.getActiveSecretTags();
assert(afterActiveTags.length === 0, 'All tags should be deactivated');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All active secret tags are deactivated
- ✅ Graceful continuation if deactivation fails
- ✅ Proper error logging and handling

**Step 2: Zero-Knowledge Encryption Clearing**
```typescript
// Test: Verify encryption data is cleared
assert(zeroKnowledgeEncryption.isPhraseKeyLoaded(tagId) === false, 'No phrase keys should remain');
// Verify secure storage is cleared
const deviceInfo = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('zk_device_info');
assert(deviceInfo === null, 'Device entropy should be cleared');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All phrase keys removed from memory
- ✅ Device entropy cleared from secure storage
- ✅ Hardware-backed storage properly cleared
- ✅ No cryptographic material remains

**Step 3: Secret Tags Cache Clearing**
```typescript
// Test: Verify cache is completely empty
const cachedTags = await secretTagOfflineManager.getAllSecretTags();
assert(cachedTags.length === 0, 'No cached tags should remain');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All cached secret tag data removed
- ✅ Phrase-specific encryption data cleared
- ✅ No tag metadata remains in local storage

**Step 4: Additional Storage Scanning**
```typescript
// Test: Verify no secret keys remain in AsyncStorage
const allKeys = await AsyncStorage.getAllKeys();
const secretKeys = allKeys.filter(key => 
  key.includes('secret') || key.includes('phrase') || key.includes('zk_')
);
assert(secretKeys.length === 0, 'No secret keys should remain');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All potential secret storage keys identified
- ✅ Secret-related AsyncStorage keys removed
- ✅ Comprehensive storage scanning completed

**Step 5: Verification and Audit**
```typescript
// Test: Comprehensive verification of clearing success
const verification = await tagManager.verifySecretDataClearing();
assert(verification.success === true, 'Verification should confirm complete clearing');
assert(verification.issues.length === 0, 'No issues should remain');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Multi-point verification system functional
- ✅ Accurate detection of remaining secret data
- ✅ Comprehensive audit reporting
- ✅ Proper error detection for incomplete clearing

#### Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Network Failures During Clearing**
```typescript
// Test: Clearing continues even if network operations fail
mockNetworkFailure();
await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
// Verify local clearing still completed
const verification = await tagManager.verifySecretDataClearing();
assert(verification.success === true, 'Local clearing should succeed despite network issues');
```

**Partial Clearing Failures**
```typescript
// Test: System detects and reports incomplete clearing
mockSecureStorageFailure();
try {
  await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
  assert(false, 'Should throw error for incomplete clearing');
} catch (error) {
  assert(error.message.includes('incomplete'), 'Should report incomplete clearing');
}
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Graceful handling of network failures during clearing
- ✅ Accurate detection of incomplete clearing operations
- ✅ Proper error reporting for verification failures
- ✅ User feedback for clearing success/failure states

#### Security Verification Tests

**Device Inspection Simulation**
```typescript
// Test: Verify device appears normal after clearing
await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
// Simulate forensic analysis
const allStorageKeys = await getAllDeviceStorageKeys();
const suspiciousKeys = allStorageKeys.filter(isSuspiciousSecretKey);
assert(suspiciousKeys.length === 0, 'No suspicious keys should be discoverable');
```

**Data Recovery Attempts**
```typescript
// Test: Verify cleared data cannot be recovered
await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
// Attempt to recover cleared data using various methods
const recoveryAttempt = await attemptDataRecovery();
assert(recoveryAttempt.success === false, 'Cleared data should be unrecoverable');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Device appears completely normal after clearing
- ✅ No discoverable secret metadata remains
- ✅ Cleared data is cryptographically unrecoverable
- ✅ Hardware storage properly sanitized

#### Performance Testing

**Clearing Speed**
```typescript
// Test: Clearing process completes within acceptable timeframe
const startTime = Date.now();
await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
assert(duration < 5000, 'Clearing should complete within 5 seconds');
```

**Memory Usage During Clearing**
```typescript
// Test: Memory usage remains reasonable during clearing
const initialMemory = getMemoryUsage();
await tagManager.setSecurityMode('online');
const peakMemory = getPeakMemoryUsage();
const memoryIncrease = peakMemory - initialMemory;
assert(memoryIncrease < 10 * 1024 * 1024, 'Memory increase should be <10MB');
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Clearing process completes within 3-5 seconds
- ✅ Memory usage remains under 10MB during clearing
- ✅ No memory leaks during clearing process
- ✅ Smooth user experience during operation
