## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

### Calendar Entry Creation UTC Date Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Calendar entry creation was failing due to timezone conversion issues when using selectedDate
**Root Cause**: When converting selectedDate (YYYY-MM-DD format) to ISO string, `new Date(selectedDate).toISOString()` was creating timezone-dependent timestamps that could shift the date by several hours
**User Experience Problem**: Entries created for specific calendar dates were appearing on wrong dates or failing to save due to timezone differences

**Solution Implemented**:
- **UTC Date Conversion**: Replaced timezone-dependent date conversion with explicit UTC date creation
- **Noon UTC Anchor**: Set selected dates to noon UTC (12:00:00) to ensure they fall within the correct day regardless of user timezone
- **Date Component Parsing**: Parse selectedDate string into year, month, day components and use `Date.UTC()` for precise UTC timestamp creation
- **Logging Enhancement**: Added logging to track date conversion process and verify UTC timestamps

**Technical Changes**:
- `useJournalEntry.ts`: Updated `performSave` function to use explicit UTC date parsing
- **Before**: `new Date(selectedDate).toISOString()` (timezone-dependent)
- **After**: `new Date(Date.UTC(year, month-1, day, 12, 0, 0, 0)).toISOString()` (UTC noon)
- **Conversion Logic**: `"2025-04-24"` → `"2025-04-24T12:00:00.000Z"` (noon UTC)

**Result**: Calendar entries now consistently use the correct selected date without timezone interference, ensuring reliable date-based filtering and display

### Calendar Entry Creation Date Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: When creating entries from calendar view, entries were always dated with current date instead of selected calendar date
**Root Cause**: Record screen didn't receive selected date information from calendar
**User Experience Problem**: Selecting April 24, 2025 on calendar and clicking "Create Entry" would create entry dated today instead of April 24

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Navigation Parameter**: Added `selectedDate` parameter to `RecordScreenParams` type
- **Calendar Integration**: Updated `CalendarScreen.handleCreateEntry()` to pass selected date to Record screen
- **Hook Enhancement**: Updated `useJournalEntry` hook to accept and use `selectedDate` parameter
- **Date Logic**: Modified entry creation to use selectedDate when provided, fallback to current date when not
- **Logging**: Added logging to track when custom dates are being used

**Technical Changes**:
- `navigation/types.ts`: Added `selectedDate?: string` to `RecordScreenParams`
- `CalendarScreen.tsx`: Updated `handleCreateEntry()` to pass `selectedDate` in navigation params
- `useJournalEntry.ts`: Added `selectedDate` option and updated `performSave` to use custom date
- `RecordScreen.tsx`: Extract `selectedDate` from route params and pass to hook

**Result**: Calendar entries now correctly use the selected calendar date instead of always using today's date

### Calendar Responsive Design Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Calendar view worked perfectly on mobile but had layout problems on desktop/fullscreen
**Root Cause**: Non-responsive design with fixed aspect ratios and percentages causing oversized calendar cells on desktop
**Problems Identified**:
- Calendar cells used `aspectRatio: 1` with `width: '100%'` making them enormous on desktop
- No maximum width constraints causing calendar to spread across entire screen
- No responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Entries list was cut off or not visible on desktop

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Added desktop (>768px), tablet (480-768px), and mobile (<480px) breakpoints
- **Calendar Constraints**: Added maximum width (600px on desktop) and centered alignment
- **Dynamic Cell Sizing**: Calculated day cell size based on available space with maximum constraints
- **Adaptive Typography**: Smaller font sizes on desktop for better density
- **ScrollView Integration**: Added ScrollView wrapper for better desktop accessibility
- **Proper Layout**: Fixed inline width styles and improved responsive layout

**Technical Changes**:
- `CalendarScreen.tsx`: Added responsive styling with Dimensions API
- **Responsive calculations**: Dynamic cell sizing based on screen width
- **Desktop optimization**: Maximum widths and proper spacing for large screens
- **Mobile compatibility**: Maintained mobile functionality and appearance
- **ScrollView wrapper**: Ensured all content is accessible on desktop

**Result**: Calendar now works perfectly on both mobile and desktop with appropriate sizing and full content visibility

### Calendar Date Filtering Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Calendar page was showing all posts instead of filtering by selected date
**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- **Primary Issue**: API parameter mismatch - frontend sending `entry_date` parameter but backend expecting `start_date` and `end_date`
- **Secondary Issue**: Date vs DateTime comparison bug - comparing `date` objects against `datetime` database fields
  - Database entries: `2025-06-05 22:37:12.102000-07:00` (full datetime with timezone)
  - Filter parameters: `2025-06-05` (date only)
  - Original logic: `entry_date <= 2025-06-05` matched only `2025-06-05 00:00:00`, missing all entries with timestamps

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Fixed API Parameters**: Updated frontend to use `start_date` and `end_date` instead of `entry_date`
- **Fixed Date Filtering Logic**: Updated backend to convert date to datetime range:
  - `start_date`: Convert to datetime at start of day (`00:00:00`)
  - `end_date`: Convert to datetime at end of day (`23:59:59.999999`)
- **Proper Date Filtering**: Both start_date and end_date set to same date for single-day filtering
- **Added Documentation**: Added parameter documentation with YYYY-MM-DD format specification
- **Consistent API Calls**: Updated both fetchEntries and fetchEntriesForSelectedDate functions
- **Hidden Mode Support**: Added include_hidden parameter for consistent API behavior

**Technical Changes**:
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Updated JournalAPI.getEntries parameter interface
- `frontend/src/screens/main/CalendarScreen.tsx`: Updated date filtering functions
- `backend/app/services/journal_service.py`: Fixed date vs datetime comparison logic
- **Result**: Calendar now correctly shows only entries for the selected date

### Console Warnings Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Multiple console warnings appearing during app usage affecting development experience
**Problems Identified**:
- **Missing React Keys**: Calendar day rendering was missing unique `key` props causing React warnings
- **setNativeProps Deprecation**: React Navigation components using deprecated setNativeProps method
- **Unexpected Text Nodes**: Recurring "Unexpected text node" errors during audio recording

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Fixed Missing Keys**: Added proper `key` props to calendar day map function using `day.toISOString()`
- **Calendar Day Rendering**: Wrapped calendar day components in keyed View containers
- **Documentation**: Acknowledged setNativeProps warnings as React Navigation library issue (not user-fixable)

**Technical Changes**:
- `CalendarScreen.tsx`: Fixed missing keys in calendar day rendering
  - **Before**: `{getDaysInMonth().map((day) => renderDay(day))}`
  - **After**: `{getDaysInMonth().map((day) => <View key={day.toISOString()}>{renderDay(day)}</View>)}`

**Result**: Reduced console warnings from React key prop violations, improving development experience

## 📋 Next Steps
Ready for additional features or bug fixes as needed.

## ⚙️ Settings Overhaul & Critical Bug Fixes (January 2025) ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Settings Page Enhancement ✅
**Summary**: The settings page was completely overhauled to remove non-functional placeholders and implement a clean, intuitive, and fully functional interface.

- **UI Simplification**: Removed over 15 placeholder settings, focusing the UI on ~6 fully implemented feature sets. This resolved user confusion and created a cleaner experience.
- **Functional Implementation**:
    - **Haptic Feedback**: A new centralized `hapticService.ts` was created to provide tactile feedback for key interactions, respecting the user's `hapticFeedbackEnabled` setting.
    - **Default Language**: The audio recorder now seamlessly uses the `defaultLanguage` from settings, simplifying the transcription workflow.
    - **Default Entry Privacy**: New journal entries now automatically respect the `defaultEntryPrivacy` setting.
    - **Notification Framework**: Built a foundational `notificationService.ts` that is aware of and responsive to user settings.
- **UX Refinement**: Fixed a confusing UI issue where "Auto-detect" language was presented as both a toggle and a dropdown option, simplifying it to a single control.

### 2. Critical Sign-Out Bug Fix ✅
**Summary**: A major security flaw that prevented users from properly signing out was identified and resolved.

- **Root Cause**: The logout function was only clearing auth tokens, leaving user data in `AsyncStorage` and the `Authorization` header in the API instance, which made the app believe the user was still logged in on restart.
- **Comprehensive Fix**:
    1.  Ensured `AsyncStorage.removeItem('user')` is called on logout.
    2.  Cleared the `Authorization` header from the global `api` instance.
    3.  Hardened the authentication state management on login, logout, and in error scenarios to prevent state inconsistencies.
- **Web Compatibility Fix**: Resolved a debugging issue where `Alert.alert` was used, which doesn't work on the web platform, by implementing platform-specific alerts (`window.confirm` for web).

### 3. Security & Code Quality Improvements ✅
**Summary**: A security audit was performed, and several code quality improvements were made to enhance application security and maintainability.

- **Removed Debug Backdoor**: Deleted a `debugStorage()` function that could expose all `AsyncStorage` content.
- **Sanitized Logs**: Removed all `console.log` statements that could expose sensitive user data like tokens or email addresses in production builds.
- **Platform-Specific Alerts**: Implemented platform-aware alerts to ensure proper functionality on both native and web.

### 4. Console Warning Resolution ✅
**Summary**: Investigated and resolved several console warnings to improve the development experience.

- **`SettingsService` Validation Fix**: Corrected a type mismatch warning by ensuring the validation logic targets only the `settings` object, not the entire storage container.
- **`setNativeProps` Deprecation**: Identified a `setNativeProps` warning as a known, cosmetic issue within the `react-native-reanimated` library on the web platform. It does not affect functionality and was documented as such.
