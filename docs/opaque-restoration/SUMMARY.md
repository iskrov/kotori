# OPAQUE Authentication Restoration - Summary

## Executive Summary

During the PBI-4 Stage 2 implementation (removal of secret-tag functionality), we accidentally disabled ALL OPAQUE authentication, not just the secret-tag features. This document summarizes the restoration effort.

## What Happened

### The Mistake
- **Intended**: Remove only secret-tag encryption features (encrypting journal entries with secret phrases)
- **Actual**: Lost ALL OPAQUE user authentication (registration/login)
- **Root Cause**: OpaqueSession model was in the same file as secret-tag models

### Impact
- Users cannot register with OPAQUE authentication
- Users cannot login with OPAQUE authentication
- Frontend OPAQUE flows are broken
- 500 errors on all OPAQUE endpoints

## What Was Restored

### Database
✅ Created `opaque_sessions` table
✅ Created `opaque_server_configs` table
✅ Added proper indexes

### Models
✅ Created new `/backend/app/models/opaque_auth.py`
✅ Restored OpaqueSession model (user auth only)
❌ Did NOT restore SecretTag, WrappedKey, VaultBlob, TagSession (correctly removed)

### Services
✅ Restored `opaque_user_service.py` - Full OPAQUE registration/login
✅ Restored `session_service.py` - Session management for OPAQUE
❌ Did NOT restore secret_tag_service.py (correctly removed)

### API Endpoints
✅ `/api/v1/auth/register/start` - OPAQUE registration phase 1
✅ `/api/v1/auth/register/finish` - OPAQUE registration phase 2
✅ `/api/v1/auth/login/start` - OPAQUE login phase 1
✅ `/api/v1/auth/login/finish` - OPAQUE login phase 2

## Current Status

### Working
- Database tables created
- Models properly separated (OpaqueSession isolated)
- Services restored with correct imports
- API endpoints fully functional (OPAQUE user registration and login)
- Verified with `frontend/scripts/opaque-smoke.js` and manual app flow

### Resolved
- 500 errors during OPAQUE flows (fixed by restoring `OpaqueSession` and services)
- Python 3.10 `datetime.UTC` import errors (replaced with `timezone.utc`)
- Stray imports from `secret_tag_opaque` (updated to `opaque_auth`)

## For the Vibes Development Team

### Key Learnings
1. **Separation of Concerns**: OPAQUE user auth should NEVER be coupled with feature-specific encryption
2. **Model Organization**: Authentication models should be in dedicated files
3. **Testing**: Need tests that verify core auth works independently

### Recommended Architecture
```
app/models/
├── opaque_auth.py        # OPAQUE user authentication ONLY
├── user.py                # User model
├── journal_entry.py       # Journal entries
└── [NO secret_tag files]  # Secret-tag feature removed
```

### Next Steps
1. Keep OPAQUE and secret-tag domains strictly separated going forward
2. Add E2E test covering OPAQUE registration/login happy path
3. Periodically validate DB migrations for idempotency on empty databases

## Important Distinction

**OPAQUE Authentication** (RESTORED):
- Zero-knowledge password authentication
- User registration and login
- Core authentication infrastructure
- MUST work for app to function

**Secret-Tag Encryption** (REMOVED - CORRECT):
- Encrypting journal entries with secret phrases
- Multiple encryption keys per user
- Complex key management
- Feature that was causing issues
