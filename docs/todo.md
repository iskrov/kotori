## Current Priority Focus

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**
1. Research and select OPAQUE library implementation
2. Set up development environment with cryptographic dependencies
3. Create basic key derivation and TagID generation functions
4. Design database migration strategy

**BLOCKERS TO RESOLVE:**
- OPAQUE library selection and compatibility verification
- Performance testing on mobile devices
- Database migration strategy for existing users
- Security audit and compliance requirements

**ESTIMATED COMPLETION:**
- Phase 1-2: 4 weeks (Foundation and Infrastructure)
- Phase 3-4: 4 weeks (Integration and Security)
- Phase 5-6: 3 weeks (Testing and Deployment)
- Total: ~11 weeks for complete OPAQUE implementation

This represents a complete architectural overhaul that will provide true zero-knowledge security while maintaining the voice-driven user experience.
