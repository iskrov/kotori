## Implementation Notes

The zero-knowledge implementation is now **COMPLETE** and provides mathematical guarantees of privacy. The system has been transformed from a trust-based architecture to a zero-knowledge architecture where:

1. **All encryption/decryption happens on the user's device**
2. **Keys are stored in hardware-backed secure storage**
3. **Server cannot access any plaintext data**
4. **Each entry has forward secrecy**
5. **Hidden mode is completely client-side**

Current focus is on comprehensive security testing, production hardening, and advanced multi-device features.
