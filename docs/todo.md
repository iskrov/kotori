## 🔒 Security Guarantees Achieved

### ✅ Zero-Knowledge Validation:
- **Server cannot decrypt any user data** - No decryption keys or methods on server
- **Hardware-backed key storage** - Keys protected by device secure enclave
- **Per-entry forward secrecy** - Each entry has unique key, deleted entries unrecoverable
- **Client-side phrase detection** - No code phrases sent to server
- **Encrypted blob storage only** - Server only sees encrypted data

### ✅ Attack Resistance:
- **Database breach protection** - Encrypted data useless without client keys
- **Server compromise protection** - No server-side decryption capability
- **Admin access protection** - No backdoors or master keys
- **Device seizure protection** - Encrypted entries invisible without phrases
- **Coercion protection** - Decoy mode and panic deletion

### ✅ Configuration Security:
- **No hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive values in environment variables
- **Required environment validation** - App fails fast if critical config missing
- **Security warnings** - Clear documentation preventing security mistakes
- **Production-ready** - Proper separation of dev/test/prod configurations
