- [ ] **Minor Issues to Resolve:**
  - [x] **RESOLVED**: Transcription callback not triggered on subsequent recordings
    - **Root Cause**: `callbackCalledRef.current` flag was set to `true` after first transcription but never reset for new recordings
    - **Solution**: Reset `callbackCalledRef.current = false` when starting a new recording in `handleMicPress`
    - **Status**: Fixed - subsequent recordings now properly trigger `handleAcceptTranscript` and auto-save
  - [x] **RESOLVED**: Multi-language transcription 500 Internal Server Error
    - **Root Cause**: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` was set to `us-central1` which doesn't support multi-language recognition
    - **Error**: "Multiple language recognition is only available in the following locations: eu, global, us"
    - **Solution**: Changed `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` from `us-central1` to `global` in backend/.env
    - **Status**: Fixed - multi-language transcription now works correctly
    - **Technical Details**: Only `eu`, `global`, and `us` locations support multi-language recognition in Speech V2 API
  - [ ] **REMAINING**: TypeScript linter error in AudioRecorder.tsx line 267 (detected_language_code type mismatch: string | null vs string | undefined)
    - **Root Cause**: Backend TranscriptionResponse model (speech.py line 74) uses `Optional[str] = None` which sends `null` in JSON
    - **Frontend Issue**: Function expects `string | undefined` but receives `string | null` from backend
    - **Attempted fixes**: Interface changes, null-to-undefined conversion, type assertions - all failed due to persistent type inference
    - **Impact**: Non-blocking - functionality works correctly, only a TypeScript compilation warning
    - **Note**: This is a cosmetic issue that doesn't affect runtime functionality

  - [x] Optimize recording component initialization
- [x] **Performance Optimizations:**
  - [x] Cache language model configurations
  - [x] Reduce transcription processing time
  - [x] Background language preference updates

**Note**: There is a minor TypeScript type compatibility issue (string | null vs string | undefined) in the AudioRecorder component that needs to be resolved. This is a cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality.
