# Vibes - Voice Journaling App Development Plan

## Project Overview

Vibes is a cross-platform voice journaling application that enables users to record, transcribe, and organize their thoughts through speech. The app features advanced **OPAQUE-based zero-knowledge encryption** for secret tags, providing military-grade security for sensitive content while maintaining perfect deniability.

## Current Status: OPAQUE Zero-Knowledge Implementation Phase

### Completed Features ✅
- **Core Voice Recording**: High-quality audio capture and playback
- **Google Speech-to-Text V2**: Advanced transcription with punctuation and formatting
- **Journal Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize entries
- **Tag System**: Public tags for categorization and filtering
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and session management
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations
- **Cross-Platform Support**: React Native for iOS, Android, and web

### Current Implementation: Secret Tags V2 (Argon2-based)
- Basic server-side hash verification
- Memory-only tag activation
- Timeout-based deactivation
- **SECURITY LIMITATION**: Metadata leakage reveals secret tag existence

## NEW ARCHITECTURE: OPAQUE Zero-Knowledge Secret Tags V3

### Revolutionary Security Model

The new implementation addresses fundamental cryptographic challenges to achieve:

1. **True Zero-Knowledge Server** - Server never sees secret phrases or content
2. **Perfect Device Deniability** - No persistent evidence of secret functionality
3. **Traffic Analysis Resistance** - OPAQUE protocol obscures authentication patterns
4. **Forward Secrecy** - Keys exist only in RAM during active sessions
5. **Duress Protection** - Panic modes and fake vault support

```

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Deterministic TagID Generation
```typescript
// No client storage needed - derived from phrase
const tagId = blake2s(secretPhrase, 16); // 128-bit identifier
```

#### 2. OPAQUE Password-Authenticated Key Exchange
```typescript
// Server learns nothing about phrase or authentication result
const authResult = await opaqueAuthenticate(phrase, tagId);
if (authResult.success) {
  // Unwrap vault keys and activate session
  const dataKeys = unwrapKeys(authResult.wrappedKeys);
}
```

#### 3. Perfect Forward Secrecy
```typescript
// Keys exist only in RAM during active session
setActiveSession({
  dataKeys,
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (5 * 60 * 1000) // 5 minutes
});

// Automatic cleanup on timeout
setTimeout(() => clearAllKeys(), timeout);
```

## Implementation Phases

- Database schema for OPAQUE verifiers and vault blobs
- Authentication endpoints with session management
- Wrapped key storage and retrieval
- Vault blob upload/download APIs

**Success Criteria**:
- OPAQUE registration and authentication endpoints functional
- Encrypted vault storage working
- No plaintext secrets stored on server

### Phase 3: Client Integration (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Integrate OPAQUE with voice journaling workflow

- Voice phrase detection with OPAQUE authentication
- Encrypted journal entry creation and retrieval
- Session management and timeout handling
- User interface for secret tag management

**Success Criteria**:

|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Server Compromise** | ❌ Hash verification reveals secret tag existence | ✅ Zero-knowledge - no secrets revealed |
| **Device Forensics** | ❌ Network traffic shows secret tag verification | ✅ No persistent evidence of secret functionality |
| **Traffic Analysis** | ❌ Authentication patterns visible | ✅ OPAQUE obscures success/failure |
| **Coercion/Duress** | ❌ Cannot deny secret tag existence | ✅ Perfect deniability + panic modes |
| **Memory Attacks** | ❌ Keys may persist in memory | ✅ Secure erasure and session isolation |
