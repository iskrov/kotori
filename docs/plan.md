## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Security Model
- **Phrase-Based Encryption**: Each secret phrase becomes its own encryption key
- **Zero Server Knowledge**: Server never sees phrases or decrypted content
- **Hardware-Backed Storage**: Keys protected by device secure enclave
- **True Isolation**: Complete independence between secret tags
- **Forward Secrecy**: Unique encryption keys per journal entry

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users and authentication
users (id, email, google_id, created_at, updated_at)

-- Journal entries with encryption support
journal_entries (
    id, user_id, title, content, entry_date,
    secret_tag_id, encrypted_content, wrapped_key,
    encryption_iv, wrap_iv, encryption_salt,
    encrypted_key, key_derivation_iterations,
    encryption_algorithm, encryption_wrap_iv,
    secret_tag_hash, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Secret tags for phrase-based encryption
secret_tags (
    id, user_id, tag_name, phrase_salt,
    phrase_hash, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Tag system for organization
tags (id, name, created_at, updated_at)
journal_entry_tags (id, entry_id, tag_id)
```
