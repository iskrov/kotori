# Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation that is no longer current but may have historical or reference value.

## Files Moved Here (January 2025)

### Implementation Documents - Superseded by Current System
- `secret_tags_implementation.md` - Documents the old phrase-based secret tags system that was replaced by OPAQUE
- `zero_knowledge_implementation.md` - Documents the old zero-knowledge implementation before OPAQUE migration
- `opaque_zero_knowledge_implementation.md` - OPAQUE design document, kept for reference after implementation completion

## Why These Were Moved

These documents described systems and implementations that have been:
1. **Fully implemented** - The features they describe are now complete
2. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer, more secure implementations (OPAQUE system)
3. **Outdated** - No longer reflect the current architecture or approach

## Current Documentation

For current system documentation, see:
- `docs/delivery/` - Current Product Backlog Items and task management
- `docs/architecture-and-feature-evolution.md` - Current system architecture
- `docs/secret_tags_testing_guide.md` - Current testing procedures
- `docs/todo.md` and `docs/done.md` - Current task management

## Reference Value

These archived documents may still be useful for:
- Understanding the evolution of the system
- Historical context for architectural decisions
- Reference for cryptographic approaches that were considered
- Troubleshooting legacy issues if they arise
